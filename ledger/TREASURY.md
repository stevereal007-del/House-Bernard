# House Bernard Treasury

## Philosophy

We use cryptocurrency infrastructure because it exists and provides permissionless access to capital formation. We do not endorse cryptocurrency as an investment or store of value.

**We believe crypto functions as a pyramid scheme.** We say this openly. We are not ideologues. We use the tools available to fund research and reward contributors. If better infrastructure existed, we would use that instead.
