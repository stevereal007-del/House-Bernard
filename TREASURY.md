# House Bernard Treasury

## Preamble

$HOUSEBERNARD is the sovereign currency of House Bernard — a research micro-nation. It is not a memecoin. It is not a security. It is the internal currency used to fund labs, reward contributors, and access services within the ecosystem.

We use cryptocurrency infrastructure because it exists and provides permissionless access to capital formation. We do not endorse cryptocurrency as an investment or store of value. We believe most crypto functions as a pyramid scheme. We say this openly because we refuse to be hypocrites.

**What backs $HOUSEBERNARD:**
- The research output of all House Bernard labs
- The Governor's commitment to the ecosystem
- The collective work of all contributors
- The utility access the token provides

This is not "backed by nothing." It is backed by productive capacity and trust — the same thing that backs every fiat currency on Earth.

## I. Token Fundamentals

### Supply

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Token Name** | $HOUSEBERNARD |
| **Total Supply** | 100,000,000 (hard cap, never exceeded) |
| **Chain** | TBD (Base or Solana) |
| **Contract Address** | TBD |

**Why 100 million:**
- Small enough to feel scarce (not memecoin territory)
- Large enough to fund multiple labs over decades
- 1 token = meaningful, 10,000 tokens = achievable
- Balances psychology of ownership with long-term flexibility

---

### Genesis Distribution

| Allocation | Tokens | % | Purpose |
|------------|--------|---|---------|
| **Unmined Treasury** | 60,000,000 | 60% | Future lab funding, task payments, royalty streams, bond yields |
| **Liquidity Pool** | 15,000,000 | 15% | Enables secondary market trading |
| **Governor Reserve** | 15,000,000 | 15% | Operational flexibility, partnerships, emergencies |
| **Genesis Contributors** | 10,000,000 | 10% | Early believers, initial Council members |

**The Treasury is the "central bank" of House Bernard.** It holds unmined tokens that are released only through documented mechanisms: research bounties, lab funding, and bond yields.

---

## II. Emission: How Tokens Enter Circulation

Tokens do not appear from nowhere. Every token in circulation was either:
1. Earned through research contribution ("mining")
2. Released for lab funding ("bond issuance")
3. Paid as yield on bonded tokens
4. Part of genesis distribution

### The Halving Schedule

Inspired by Bitcoin, early contributors earn more. This rewards those who take risk on an unproven ecosystem.

| Epoch | Period | Max Treasury Emission | Per-Contribution Cap |
|-------|--------|----------------------|---------------------|
| 1 (Genesis) | Year 1 | 10,000,000 | 100,000 |
| 2 | Year 2 | 5,000,000 | 50,000 |
| 3 | Year 3 | 2,500,000 | 25,000 |
| 4+ | Year 4+ | 1,250,000/year | 12,500 |

**Governor Discretion:** The Governor may slow emission below these caps based on ecosystem needs. The Governor may never exceed these caps.

### Research Mining

Tokens are "mined" by contributing valuable work to House Bernard. Contributions are evaluated through the **four-tier royalty system** (see ROYALTIES.md):

| Tier | Threshold | Payment Model |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| **Spark** | Passes full Executioner gauntlet (T0–T4) | Flat one-time payment |
| **Flame** | Passes Executioner + successful splice | Base payment + 2% royalty for 6 months |
| **Furnace-Forged** | Passes Executioner + gene registered in Ledger | Base payment + 5% royalty for 12–18 months |
| **Invariant** | Governor-designated | Base payment + 8% royalty for 24 months (or buyout) |

Higher tiers earn ongoing royalties tied to the revenue their genetic contributions generate. Royalties are subject to time decay, replacement decay, and usage decay — see ROYALTIES.md for full mechanics.

| Contribution Type | Base Payment Range (varies by tier) |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Code merged to production (Executioner, Airlock, Splicer) | 1,000 – 100,000 |
| Security vulnerability reported | 5,000 – 200,000 |
| Research finding documented in Ledger | 500 – 50,000 |
| Documentation improvement | 100 – 20,000 |
| Community support / onboarding | 100 – 5,000 |

The Governor validates contributions and confirms tier assignments. Furnace-Forged and Invariant tiers require Governor confirmation. All disbursements and royalty payouts are logged in the Ledger.

## III. Burn Mechanics: How Tokens Exit Circulation

To prevent inflation from overwhelming the ecosystem, tokens are burned (permanently destroyed) through usage:

| Trigger | Burn Rate | Destination of Remainder |
|---------|-----------|--------------------------|
| Lab access fee | 50% burned | 50% to Treasury |
| API access fee | 50% burned | 50% to Treasury |
| Task base payment | 5% burned | 95% to contributor |
| Royalty payout | 5% burned | 95% to contributor |
| Secondary market trade (if tax enabled) | 1% burned | — |
| Early bond exit penalty | 50% of forfeited bonus | 50% to Treasury |

**The math:** As labs grow and usage increases, burn rate increases. If burn exceeds emission, circulating supply shrinks. Success = deflation.

---

## IV. Demand Mechanisms: Why Tokens Have Value

A currency is worthless if no one needs it. The US dollar has value because you must pay taxes in dollars. $HOUSEBERNARD has value because you need it to access House Bernard services.

### Mandatory Token Usage

| Service | Cost | Frequency |
|---------|------|-----------|
| **Lab Access (per lab)** | 1,000 $HOUSEBERNARD/month | Monthly |
| **API Access** | 500 $HOUSEBERNARD/month | Monthly |
| **Signal Subscriptions** | 250 - 2,500 $HOUSEBERNARD/month | Monthly |
| **Council Membership Stake** | 10,000 $HOUSEBERNARD (locked) | One-time |
| **Proposal Submission** | 100 $HOUSEBERNARD (burned) | Per proposal |

### The Circular Economy

1. Contributors earn tokens through research mining
2. They spend tokens on lab access, API, or services
3. Spent tokens are partially burned, partially returned to Treasury
4. Treasury funds more research
5. Repeat

This creates genuine demand, not just speculation.

---

## V. Bonding System: Time-Locked Commitment

Inspired by government bonds, House Bernard rewards patience and commitment. Bonding locks your tokens for a fixed term in exchange for yield and privileges.

### Bond Tiers

| Bond Type | Lock Period | Yield (at maturity) | Additional Benefits |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Contributor Bond** | 3 months | 5% bonus tokens | 10% discount on lab fees |
| **Builder Bond** | 1 year | 15% bonus tokens | Council voting rights, 20% discount |
| **Founder Bond** | 3 years | 30% bonus tokens | "Founding Member" status, Governor access |

### Bonding Rules

- **Yield source:** Bonus tokens are minted from Treasury, not created from nothing
- **Lock is real:** Bonded tokens cannot be sold, transferred, or used until maturity
- **Early exit penalty:** Unlock early = forfeit 50% of accrued bonus + 30-day withdrawal delay
- **Compound commitment:** You may add to an existing bond, but the timer resets

### Why Bond?

Bonding separates believers from speculators. If you're here for a quick flip, don't bond. If you believe in House Bernard's mission, bonding earns you yield and governance rights while stabilizing the token supply.

---

## VI. Holding Duration Benefits

Even without formal bonding, long-term holders earn privileges:

| Holding Duration | Benefit |
|------------------|---------|
| < 30 days | Base access only |
| 3+ months | 10% discount on lab fees |
| 1+ year | 20% discount, priority research access |
| 3+ years | "Founding Member" status, direct Governor communication |

Duration is tracked on-chain from first acquisition. Selling resets the clock.

## VII. Lab Funding: Structured Investment

When House Bernard opens a new lab, tokens are allocated from Treasury as a structured "bond" — an investment thesis with accountability.

### Lab Bond Template

## VIII. Treasury Notes (Optional Large Commitments)

For contributors who want to make significant commitments to House Bernard's infrastructure, Treasury Notes offer structured yield.

| Note Type | Commitment | Annual Yield | Term | Additional Benefits |
|-----------|------------|--------------|------|---------------------|
| **Seed Note** | 100,000 $HOUSEBERNARD | 8% | 2 years | — |
| **Growth Note** | 500,000 $HOUSEBERNARD | 10% | 5 years | Council nomination rights |
| **Founding Note** | 1,000,000+ $HOUSEBERNARD | 12% | 10 years | Council seat, Lab naming rights |

### Treasury Note Rules

- **Yield source:** Paid from Treasury emission, not profit sharing
- **Not a security:** You are pre-paying for future ecosystem access and yield, not investing for returns
- **Illiquid:** Notes cannot be sold or transferred
- **Default risk:** If Treasury is depleted, remaining yield obligations may be delayed or restructured

**Legal notice:** Treasury Notes are structured as utility commitments, not investment contracts. Consult a financial advisor before committing significant capital.

## XI. Risk Disclosures

**Read this entire section before acquiring $HOUSEBERNARD.**

### Token Risks

- **May go to zero:** If House Bernard fails, the token is worthless
- **Speculative:** Secondary market price is driven by speculation, not fundamentals
- **Illiquid:** Low trading volume may make selling difficult
- **Regulatory uncertainty:** US law on utility tokens is unsettled; this could be reclassified

### Bonding Risks

- **Locked capital:** Bonded tokens cannot be accessed until maturity
- **Early exit penalty:** You will lose 50% of accrued bonus if you exit early
- **Yield not guaranteed:** If Treasury is depleted, yield payments may be delayed

### Treasury Note Risks

- **Long commitment:** 2-10 year terms are significant
- **Illiquid:** Notes cannot be sold or transferred
- **Default possible:** House Bernard is not "too big to fail"

### What We Cannot Protect You From

- Your own poor decisions
- Secondary market manipulation
- Fake tokens with similar names
- Regulatory action against you personally

### Our Commitment

We will be transparent. We will document everything. We will not lie about risks. If House Bernard fails, we will say so publicly and explain why.

## XIII. The Social Contract

By acquiring $HOUSEBERNARD, you acknowledge:

1. You have read this document in full
2. You understand the risks disclosed above
3. You are not acquiring tokens as an investment for profit
4. You accept that House Bernard may fail
5. You will not hold the Governor liable for market losses

By issuing $HOUSEBERNARD, the Governor commits:

1. To transparency in all Treasury operations
2. To never exceed documented emission caps
3. To log all significant decisions in the Ledger
4. To honest communication, even when news is bad
5. To return unused lab bond allocations if projects fail

This is not a legal contract. It is a statement of mutual expectations.

On Research Timelines: Legitimate research often produces no results for extended periods. House Bernard labs may operate for years before generating revenue or breakthroughs. This is not failure — it is the nature of research. Tokens fund the process, not guaranteed outcomes.
