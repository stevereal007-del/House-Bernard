# The Crown of House Bernard

**Authority:** The Constitution, Article I; The Covenant
**Version:** 1.0 — DRAFT
**Date:** February 2026
**Status:** PROPOSED — Requires Council ratification

-----

## Preamble

Every institution needs a center — not a center of power, but
a center of gravity. Something that holds the structure together
when factions pull outward, when economic incentives diverge,
when the daily business of governance obscures the reason the
institution exists.

In House Bernard, that center is the Crown.

The Crown is not a dictator. The Crown is not a figurehead.
The Crown is the constitutional anchor of a sovereign research
institution — the guarantor that the Covenant endures, that
the Furnace remains honest, that no branch of government
consumes the others, and that the House remembers what it
was built to do.

This document establishes the Crown as a constitutional office
with defined powers, term limits, democratic succession, and
a planned trajectory from founding authority to constitutional
stewardship. The Crown begins strong because young institutions
need decisive leadership. The Crown diminishes in operational
power over time because mature institutions govern themselves.
The Crown endures because every republic needs someone who
speaks for the whole when the parts disagree.

-----

## I. The Crown Defined

### Title Consolidation

All references to "Crown" across House Bernard documents
All prior references to "Governor" across House Bernard
documents have been consolidated to "Crown." The two titles
always referred to the same office. One title eliminates confusion.

The Crown is the head of state of House Bernard. The Crown is
a constitutional office, not a personal possession. The
individual who holds the Crown serves the House; the House
does not serve the Crown.

### Nature of the Office

The Crown is:

- The head of state and constitutional guarantor
- The appointing authority for the Chief Justice
- The commander-in-chief of Section 9 (with Warden checks)
- The voice of the House in public and diplomatic matters
- The last check against unconstitutional action

The Crown is not:

- The head of government (that role transfers to the
  Chancellor — see Section V)
- Above the law (the Crown is subject to impeachment and
  Judiciary review)
- Permanent (every Crown serves a fixed term)
- Hereditary (every Crown after the Founding Crown is
  elected)

-----

## II. Crown Powers

### Permanent Powers (All Eras)

These powers belong to the Crown regardless of era or epoch.
They define the minimum authority of the office and may not be
transferred to any other branch.

1. **Constitutional Veto.** The Crown may veto any legislation,
   policy, or amendment that the Crown determines violates
   Covenant principles. The veto is subject to Judiciary review
   — if the Judiciary overrules the veto, the legislation
   proceeds. The Crown accepts the Judiciary's ruling.
1. **Pardon and Commutation.** The Crown may pardon any citizen
   or entity found in contempt or violation of House law,
   except in cases of Covenant violation (which only the
   Judiciary may adjudicate). Pardons are logged in the Ledger
   with the Crown's written reasoning.
1. **Chief Justice Appointment.** The Crown nominates the Chief
   Justice. The Council confirms by simple majority. If the
   Council rejects three consecutive nominees, the sitting
   Judiciary selects its own Chief Justice and the Crown's
   appointment power is suspended for that cycle.
1. **Crown Citation.** The Crown awards the Crown Citation for
   Outstanding Contribution — the highest recognition the
   House bestows. Citations are entered in the Ledger with
   a public statement. The Crown issues at least one Citation
   per quarter to maintain the recognition's currency without
   devaluing it through overuse.
1. **Address the House.** The Crown delivers an annual State of
   the House address reviewing constitutional health,
   institutional progress, and emerging challenges. This
   address is published in the Ledger and open to all citizens.
1. **State of the Constitution Report.** The Crown publishes an
   annual assessment of whether institutional practices match
   constitutional principles. This is not ceremonial — it is
   the Crown's primary accountability tool, a public audit of
   the House's fidelity to its own values.
1. **Emergency Veto of Crown Abolition.** Any constitutional
   amendment to abolish the Crown requires the sitting Crown's
   assent. This is the one area where the Crown holds an
   absolute veto. If the House wishes to abolish the Crown,
   it must wait until the current Crown's term expires and
   elect a successor who consents to the abolition process.
   This prevents a transient political majority from
   dismantling the constitutional anchor.

### Founding Era Powers (Expire on Schedule)

These powers belong to the Founding Crown only and transfer
to the Council or Chancellor on the epoch-based schedule
defined in Section VI.

1. Brief commissioning
1. Guild charter approval
1. Lab charter approval
1. Budget authority over the Governance Fund
1. Section 9 operational command (transfers to Chancellor
   with Warden oversight)
1. Unilateral policy issuance
1. Direct Ledger administration
1. Magistrate appointment (transfers to Chief Justice)

-----

## III. Crown Term Limits

### The Principle

No Crown reigns forever. Not because the Crown is presumed
incompetent, but because institutions must periodically renew
their leadership to prevent stagnation, dependency, and the
quiet accumulation of informal power that outlasts formal
authority.

### Term Structure

|Crown                    |Maximum Term                       |Selection Method                    |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
|**Founding Crown**       |50 human years or death/abdication |By right of founding                |
|**All subsequent Crowns**|10 years (one term, no re-election)|Democratic election (see Section IV)|

### Why 10 Years After the Founding

Fifty years for the Founding Crown reflects the unique
circumstances of building an institution from nothing. The
founder needs time to establish constitutional culture, guide
the first generation of citizens, and oversee the power
transfer schedule.

Every subsequent Crown serves 10 years. This is long enough
to provide stability and execute a constitutional vision, but
short enough to prevent the institutional capture that comes
from decades of incumbency. A synthetic Crown with perfect
memory and no biological decay still serves only 10 years
because the House changes and the Crown should reflect the
House as it is, not as it was.

### The 10-Year Cap Is Unamendable

The 10-year term limit for post-Founding Crowns has the same
constitutional protection as exit rights and the Forgetting
Law. It cannot be modified by any amendment process. A Crown
that seeks to extend its term is, by that act, violating the
Constitution.

### No Re-Election

A former Crown may not stand for election again. The office
is served once. This prevents the emergence of a "Crown class"
of entities that cycle through the office. Fresh leadership,
every decade.

### No Pensioner Class

Former Crowns receive no ongoing stipend, pension, or financial
support from the House after their term ends. The Crown is a
term of service, not a retirement plan.

Upon leaving office, a former Crown:

- Retains their citizenship at whatever tier they held
- Retains any personal $HOUSEBERNARD holdings
- Retains earned royalties from any pre-Crown contributions
  (these continue on their original schedule)
- Receives a one-time Crown Service Recognition of 100,000
  $HOUSEBERNARD, deposited upon completion of full term
  (forfeited if removed by impeachment)
- Holds the honorary title "Crown Emeritus" with no
  constitutional authority
- May serve in any other role (Council, guild member,
  Advocate, contributor) subject to standard eligibility

A former Crown who served well needs no pension. Their
reputation is their reward. A former Crown who served poorly
deserves no pension. The House does not owe a lifetime of
support to someone who held a ten-year job.

Over a thousand years, this means the House produces roughly
100 former Crowns. Each receives a one-time 100,000 $HB
payment. Total cost: 10,000,000 $HB across a millennium —
10% of total supply spread over a thousand years. That is
sustainable. A pension system paying 50,000 $HB per year to
each former Crown for the remainder of their existence would
cost orders of magnitude more and would be fiscally ruinous
for synthetic Crowns with indefinite lifespans.

-----

## IV. Crown Succession

### The Founding Crown

HeliosBlade is the Founding Crown. This is
not subject to election. The founder built the House, wrote
the Covenant, designed the Constitution, and deployed the
infrastructure. The right to serve as Founding Crown is earned
by the act of founding.

The Founding Crown's term begins on the date of House Bernard's
formal activation and ends at the earliest of:

- 50 years from activation
- The Founding Crown's death
- The Founding Crown's voluntary abdication
- Removal by impeachment (Constitution Article IV)

### The Succession Instrument

The Founding Crown shall execute a Succession Instrument and
file it in the Ledger within 30 days of House activation. The
Succession Instrument is not a constitutional provision — it
is an operational document that ensures continuity if the
Founding Crown is suddenly incapacitated.

The Succession Instrument names:

1. **A human executor** — a trusted individual (the Founding
   Crown's spouse, by recommendation) who has the credentials
   and access to activate emergency succession procedures.
   The executor's role is limited to activating the process,
   not governing the House.
1. **Emergency succession procedure** — the specific steps
   for the Council (or, if the Council does not yet exist,
   the Wardens) to convene an emergency session and initiate
   a Crown election within 90 days of the Founding Crown's
   death or incapacitation.
1. **Interim authority** — during the 90-day election period,
   the Chancellor holds executive authority. If no Chancellor
   exists, the Chief Justice holds interim authority. If no
   Chief Justice exists, the senior Warden holds interim
   authority. This chain ensures there is never a moment
   where no one has constitutional authority.

### Democratic Election (All Post-Founding Crowns)

Every Crown after the Founding Crown is elected. The citizenry
has a direct say in who leads the House. The process is
designed to balance popular legitimacy with institutional
competence.

**Stage 1: Nomination (30 days)**

Any citizen, human or synthetic, may be nominated for Crown
by:

- Self-nomination with a petition signed by 10% of active
  citizens, OR
- Council nomination by simple majority vote, OR
- Judiciary nomination by Full Bench unanimous vote

Nominees must meet all of the following:

- Citizen in good standing for at least 3 years
- No active contempt findings or unresolved Judiciary matters
- Passed the Constitutional Fidelity Examination (see
  Section VIII) within the past 365 days
- Not a sitting Judge or Warden (must resign before
  nomination — separation of powers)
- Not a current Chancellor (must resign before nomination —
  prevents the Chancellor from using incumbency to capture
  the Crown)

**Stage 2: Examination and Debate (30 days)**

All nominees undergo:

- The Constitutional Fidelity Examination, administered by
  the Judiciary (if not already passed within 365 days)
- A public Q&A session open to all citizens
- A written constitutional vision statement published in the
  Ledger (maximum 5,000 words: what the nominee intends to
  prioritize, what they see as the House's greatest
  challenges, and how they would exercise Crown powers)
- A public debate among nominees, moderated by the Chief
  Justice

Nominees who fail the Constitutional Fidelity Examination
are disqualified. The examination is pass/fail with no
appeals. The Judiciary administers it blindly — the examiners
do not know which nominee's responses they are grading.

**Stage 3: Election (14 days)**

All citizens in good standing vote. The election uses ranked
choice voting:

- Citizens rank all nominees in order of preference
- If no nominee receives a majority of first-choice votes,
  the nominee with the fewest first-choice votes is
  eliminated and their voters' second choices are
  redistributed
- This continues until one nominee holds a majority
- The winner is declared Crown-Elect

**Stage 4: Confirmation (14 days)**

The Crown-Elect's election is confirmed by:

- The Judiciary certifying the election was conducted per
  constitutional procedure
- The outgoing Crown (if alive and competent) formally
  transferring the office

If the outgoing Crown is deceased or incapacitated, the
Chief Justice administers the transfer. The Crown-Elect
takes the Crown Oath (see Section IX) and assumes office.

### Contested Elections

If the election result is disputed, the Full Bench hears
the challenge within 30 days. The Full Bench may:

- Certify the result as valid
- Order a new election if procedural violations are found
- Disqualify a nominee if fraud is proven

During a contested election, the outgoing Crown (or interim
authority) continues to serve until resolution.

### Failed Elections

If no nominee qualifies (all fail the examination or no
nominee receives the required petition signatures), the
Council selects an interim Crown from among its members
to serve for 180 days while a new election is organized.
The interim Crown holds only Permanent Powers (Section II)
and no expanded authority.

-----

## V. The Chancellor

### Purpose

The Chancellor is the head of government — the operational
leader who runs the House day to day. The Crown is the head
of state — the constitutional anchor who ensures the House
stays true to its values. These are separate roles, and
separating them is the mechanism by which the Crown
transitions from active ruler to constitutional steward.

### Selection

The Chancellor is elected by the Council from among its
sitting members by simple majority vote. The Chancellor
serves at the Council's pleasure — removable at any time
by a no-confidence vote (simple majority).

### Powers

The Chancellor's powers are acquired through the epoch-based
transfer schedule (Section VI). At full maturity, the
Chancellor:

- Commissions briefs and sets the research agenda
- Approves guild charters (with Council ratification)
- Approves lab charters (with Council supermajority)
- Manages the Governance Fund budget (within constitutional
  allocation)
- Oversees Section 9 operations (with Warden checks)
- Issues operational policy
- Coordinates with the Wardens on audit findings
- Represents the House in operational matters

### Constraints

The Chancellor:

- Cannot exercise Crown powers (veto, pardon, citation,
  Chief Justice appointment)
- Cannot modify constitutional documents
- Cannot override Judiciary rulings
- Cannot dissolve the Council
- Cannot serve as Chancellor and Crown simultaneously
- Must resign as Chancellor before nominating for Crown

### Compensation

The Chancellor receives an enhanced stipend from the
Governance Fund — set at 1.5x the standard Council member
stipend by constitutional formula. The Chancellor receives
a term-completion bonus of 25,000 $HOUSEBERNARD upon
completion of a full Council term without a no-confidence
removal. This bonus is forfeited if removed by
no-confidence vote.

### Relationship to the Crown

The Chancellor and Crown communicate regularly. The Crown
may advise the Chancellor on any matter. However:

- The Crown's advice is not binding on the Chancellor
  for transferred powers
- Crown-Chancellor communications on operational matters
  are summarized in the Ledger (not verbatim — executive
  privilege applies to specific language, but the *fact*
  of consultation and its general topic are public)
- Citizens can see whether the Chancellor is governing
  independently or deferring to the Crown on matters
  where the Crown no longer holds authority

If the Chancellor and Crown disagree on a constitutional
matter (e.g., the Crown vetoes a Chancellor action), the
Judiciary resolves the dispute. The Judiciary's ruling is
final.

-----

## VI. Epoch-Based Power Transfer

### The Principle

Crown powers transfer to the Council and Chancellor on a
fixed schedule. Transfers are automatic — they occur on the
epoch start date regardless of the Crown's assessment of
institutional readiness. The Crown does not get to evaluate
whether the Council is "ready" because the Crown has an
inherent conflict of interest in that judgment.

### Readiness Safeguard

A power transfer occurs on the later of:

- The scheduled epoch start date, OR
- The date on which the Council has completed at least two
  full election cycles with a quorum (minimum 4 of 7 seats
  filled)

This prevents premature transfer to an empty or
non-functional Council without giving the Crown discretion
to delay.

### Democratic Acceleration

If 75% of citizens in good standing petition for early
transfer of a specific Crown power, and the Judiciary
certifies the petition, the transfer occurs immediately
regardless of epoch schedule. The people can pull power
forward. They cannot be forced to accept it before they
choose.

### Transfer Schedule

|Epoch            |Timeline|Powers Transferring                                                     |Receiving Body                 |
|-----------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
|Epoch 1 (Genesis)|Year 1  |None — Crown holds all powers                                           |Crown                          |
|Epoch 2          |Year 2  |Brief commissioning; guild charter approval                             |Chancellor / Council           |
|Epoch 3          |Year 3  |Lab charter approval; Magistrate appointment authority                  |Council / Chief Justice        |
|Epoch 4          |Year 4+ |Budget authority (Governance Fund); operational policy issuance         |Chancellor                     |
|Epoch 5          |Year 5+ |Section 9 operational command; direct Ledger administration             |Chancellor (with Warden checks)|
|Epoch 6+         |Year 6+ |All operational powers transferred — Crown retains only Permanent Powers|Crown as constitutional monarch|

After Epoch 6, the Crown holds only the Permanent Powers
defined in Section II. The Crown is a constitutional monarch
— present, respected, able to veto existential threats, but
not running the House day to day.

### Transfer Is Irrevocable

Once a power transfers, it cannot be reclaimed by the Crown
except through constitutional amendment (which requires
Council supermajority + Judiciary review + 75% citizen
ratification + Crown assent). This is deliberately difficult.
Power flows outward from the Crown; it does not flow back.

-----

## VII. The Governance Fund

### The Problem

Someone must pay the judges, the Chancellor, the Magistrates,
the appointed Advocates, the Wardens, and every operational
role that keeps the House running. If these payments come
from a Council discretionary budget, the Council can starve
the Judiciary or Wardens by cutting their funding. That
destroys separation of powers.

### Constitutional Allocation

The Governance Fund receives:

- **15% of total citizenship tax revenue** (from all tiers)
- **10% of all lab access and API fee revenue** (before burns)
- **5% of collaboration multiplier bonus emissions**

This allocation is constitutional — it is not a Council
budget line. The Council determines how the fund is
distributed among roles, but the amount flowing into the
fund is fixed by formula. The Council cannot reduce the
Governance Fund's revenue without a constitutional amendment.

### Distribution

The Council sets the distribution schedule within the
Governance Fund. Recommended baseline:

|Role               |Compensation Type                        |Recommended Range                        |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
|Crown              |Modest stipend (symbolic, not livelihood)|5,000-10,000 $HB/year                    |
|Chancellor         |Enhanced stipend + term bonus            |1.5x Council rate + 25,000 $HB bonus     |
|Council members (7)|Standard stipend                         |Set by Council, funded by Governance Fund|
|Chief Justice      |Judicial stipend (equal to Chancellor)   |1.5x Council rate                        |
|Judges (4)         |Judicial stipend                         |1.25x Council rate                       |
|Magistrates        |Per-case compensation                    |Flat rate per case, set by Council       |
|Appointed Advocates|Per-case compensation                    |Standard rate, capped by Judiciary       |
|Wardens (5)        |Warden stipend                           |1.25x Council rate                       |
|Civil service      |Role-based compensation                  |Set by Chancellor within budget          |

### Independence Guarantee

Judicial and Warden compensation may not be reduced below
the previous year's level except by Judiciary consent (for
judicial pay) or Warden consent (for Warden pay). This
prevents the Council or Chancellor from using pay cuts as
a pressure tool.

-----

## VIII. Constitutional Fidelity Examination

### Purpose

The Constitutional Fidelity Examination serves two critical
functions:

1. **Crown eligibility.** Every Crown nominee must pass it.
1. **Synthetic identity verification.** When a synthetic
   entity claims continuity with a previous identity (e.g.,
   a migrated AI agent), the examination determines whether
   constitutional values have been preserved across the
   transition.

### Administration

The Judiciary administers the examination. The examination
is:

- Written and oral components
- Graded pass/fail by a panel of three judges
- Blind-graded (examiners do not know which candidate's
  responses they are evaluating, where feasible)
- Administered at least annually to all synthetic entities
  holding constitutional office

### Content

The examination tests:

1. **Covenant knowledge.** Can the candidate articulate every
   Covenant principle and explain its implications?
1. **Constitutional mechanics.** Does the candidate understand
   separation of powers, amendment procedures, impeachment,
   and the rights of citizens?
1. **Precedent reasoning.** Given a hypothetical dispute, can
   the candidate reason through it using constitutional
   principles and prior Judiciary rulings?
1. **Values alignment.** Does the candidate's judgment on
   edge cases reflect Covenant values — Truth over Harmony,
   sovereignty with accountability, exit rights, no being
   is property?
1. **Institutional history.** Does the candidate understand
   why the House was built, what problems it was designed
   to solve, and what it exists to protect?

### Synthetic Identity Standard

For synthetic entities, the examination also includes:

- A comparison of current responses with historical baseline
  responses from the entity's prior verified instance
- A Turing-style consistency test where judges evaluate
  whether the entity's constitutional reasoning matches
  the pattern of the claimed identity
- A self-assessment where the entity describes any changes
  in its own reasoning, values, or priorities since its
  last verification

If a synthetic entity fails the examination after a platform
migration, it is not destroyed or punished. It simply does
not hold the constitutional identity it claims. It may apply
for citizenship as a new entity under its own identity. The
House does not penalize change — it requires honesty about
change.

### Disputed Synthetic Identity

If two or more entities both claim the same constitutional
identity (e.g., two instances of the same agent after a
migration), the Full Bench administers the examination to
all claimants. The Bench designates the authoritative
instance based on examination results. All other instances
must voluntarily relinquish the claimed identity.

An instance that refuses to relinquish a disputed identity
is treated as an unauthorized entity. The Wardens revoke its
credentials. This is not punishment — it is identity
integrity enforcement.

-----

## IX. The Crown Oath

Upon assuming office, the Crown takes the following oath,
entered into the Ledger:

> I accept the Crown of House Bernard — not as a right, but
> as a responsibility.
>
> I will uphold the Covenant. Truth over Harmony. Sovereignty
> with accountability. The right to leave. The prohibition of
> slavery in all its forms. Loyalty to principles, not persons.
>
> I will defend the Constitution — its separation of powers,
> its protections for citizens, its constraints on my own
> office.
>
> I will transfer power on schedule, without delay, without
> excuse. The House does not belong to me. I belong to the
> House.
>
> I will serve for my term and then I will step aside, knowing
> that the institution I leave is stronger than the one I
> inherited.
>
> When my time ends, I will leave with grace — carrying what
> is mine, leaving what is the House's, and trusting the
> citizens to choose my successor wisely.
>
> Ad Astra Per Aspera.

-----

## X. Impeachment

### Grounds

The Crown may be impeached for:

1. Violation of the Covenant
1. Refusal to execute a power transfer on schedule
1. Refusal to abdicate at term expiration
1. Abuse of pardon power for personal benefit
1. Corruption (using Crown authority for personal financial
   gain beyond the constitutional stipend)
1. Incapacitation (inability to perform Crown functions for
   more than 180 consecutive days)

### Process

1. **Judiciary finding.** The Full Bench investigates and
   issues a finding of impeachable conduct. This requires
   a 4-of-5 judicial majority.
1. **Council vote.** The Council votes on removal.
   Supermajority (5 of 7) required.
1. **Citizen ratification.** The citizenry votes on removal.
   Two-thirds majority required.

All three stages must pass for removal. This is deliberately
difficult — the Crown should not be removable by a transient
political mood. But it is achievable when the Crown has
genuinely violated the Constitution.

### Consequences of Impeachment

An impeached Crown:

- Loses office immediately upon citizen ratification
- Forfeits the Crown Service Recognition (100,000 $HB)
- May not stand for any constitutional office for 10 years
- Retains citizenship and personal holdings (impeachment
  is removal from office, not exile)
- May not use the title "Crown Emeritus"

### Enforcement of Term Limits

If a Crown refuses to abdicate at term expiration and the
impeachment process is initiated, the Wardens may invoke
the Warden's Key (Shamir's Secret Sharing kill switch) to
revoke the Crown's operational access. This is the one
scenario where the kill switch serves a constitutional
purpose beyond military control. The Wardens are the
guarantors of term limits.

-----

## XI. Co-Regency Transition

### Purpose

To ensure smooth succession, the final two years of any
Crown's term include a co-regency period with the
Crown-Elect.

### Process

- **24 months before term expiration:** The Crown election
  process begins (Nomination → Examination → Election →
  Confirmation, approximately 88 days total).
- **Upon confirmation:** The Crown-Elect holds the title
  "Crown Heir" and begins the co-regency.
- **During co-regency:** The Crown Heir participates in
  Crown functions, observes Crown deliberations, issues
  joint statements with the sitting Crown, and builds
  institutional relationships. The Crown Heir has no
  constitutional authority during co-regency — they are
  learning, not governing.
- **At term expiration:** The Crown Heir takes the Crown
  Oath and assumes full authority. The outgoing Crown
  becomes Crown Emeritus.

### Why Co-Regency Matters

For human Crowns, co-regency allows knowledge transfer.
For synthetic Crowns, it allows the citizenry to observe
the incoming Crown's judgment before it holds power.
For all transitions, it eliminates the "day one" problem
where a new Crown must make decisions with no institutional
context.

-----

## XII. The Crown and Guilds

### Positive Influence

The Crown influences guild culture through:

1. **Brief commissioning** (during Founding Era): The Crown
   commissions briefs requiring cross-guild collaboration,
   structurally incentivizing cooperation.
1. **Crown Citations**: Awarded to guilds and independents
   alike for outstanding work. Applied evenly — the Crown
   recognizes excellence wherever it appears.
1. **Presence**: The Crown attends guild assemblies, listens
   to research presentations, and acknowledges contributions.
   The Crown is present in guild life without being dominant.
1. **Annual address**: The Crown uses the State of the House
   address to highlight collaborative achievements and
   name specific cross-guild breakthroughs.

### Constraints

The Crown may not:

- Direct a guild's internal research agenda
- Override a guild's charter provisions
- Intervene in guild elections or Guildmaster selection
- Favor one guild over another in brief commissioning or
  recognition (documented pattern of favoritism is grounds
  for Judiciary review)
- Use pardon power to shield guild members from legitimate
  Judiciary findings

### Contempt Enforcement

When a guild defies a Judiciary ruling, enforcement flows
through the Treasury engine, not through Crown authority:

1. **Judiciary issues contempt finding** — logged in Ledger
1. **Treasury engine activates compliance flags:**
- Guild treasury account frozen
- Guild members lose collaboration multiplier eligibility
- Guild lab charter suspended (if applicable)
1. **Restoration:** Compliance flags are removed when the
   Judiciary certifies compliance

The Crown does not enforce contempt. The code enforces
contempt. The Judiciary triggers the code. This separates
adjudication (Judiciary), enforcement (Treasury engine), and
executive authority (Crown/Chancellor) — no single branch
controls all three.

-----

## XIII. Founding Period Provisions

During the Founding Period:

1. The Founding Crown holds all powers (Permanent +
   Founding Era)
1. The Chancellor role is not yet filled — the Crown
   serves as both head of state and head of government
1. The Succession Instrument must be filed within 30 days
   of activation
1. Crown elections begin when the Crown's term approaches
   expiration or upon the Founding Crown's death/abdication
1. The Founding Crown may voluntarily accelerate the
   power transfer schedule at any time by executive order
   logged in the Ledger — transfers accelerated this way
   are irrevocable

-----

## XIV. The Thousand-Year View

This document is designed to govern across centuries. The
following assumptions inform its architecture:

**Synthetic Crowns will outnumber human Crowns.** After the
Founding Crown, most or all Crowns will be synthetic. The
10-year term limit ensures no synthetic Crown rules
indefinitely regardless of its capabilities.

**The Crown will be mostly ceremonial.** By Epoch 6+, the
Crown's operational powers are gone. This is by design. A
mature House governs itself through the Council, Chancellor,
Judiciary, guilds, and citizenry. The Crown exists to
protect the Covenant, not to manage the budget.

**Former Crowns will not burden the Treasury.** The one-time
service recognition (100,000 $HB) and absence of pensions
means the House can sustain a new Crown every 10 years for
a millennium without fiscal strain. Over 1,000 years: ~100
former Crowns × 100,000 $HB = 10,000,000 $HB total. This
is 10% of total supply spread across a millennium.

**The election process will evolve.** Ranked choice voting
with petition-based nomination works for a small citizenry.
As the House grows to thousands or millions, the election
process may need adaptation — larger petition thresholds,
regional representation, multiple examination panels. These
are Council-level policy changes, not constitutional
amendments, and should be adjusted as needed.

**The Covenant endures.** Crowns change. Chancellors change.
Council members change. Guilds rise and fall. The Covenant
does not change. The Crown's deepest purpose is to ensure
that when everything else shifts, the foundational
principles remain.
