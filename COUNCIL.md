### Removal Process

Council members may be removed by:

1. **Voluntary resignation** — Member notifies Governor

If the Governor becomes permanently unable to fulfill duties:

### Order of Succession

1. **Appointed Successor** — If the Governor has designated one in writing
2. **Senior Council Member** — Longest-serving active Council member
3. **Treasury Lockdown** — If no successor exists, Treasury operations halt

### Succession Triggers

- Governor publicly announces resignation
- Governor is unreachable for 90+ consecutive days
- Governor is deceased (verified through public records)

### Succession Process

1. Successor assumes Governor title
2. This document is updated
3. Wallet control transfers (requires pre-arranged multisig or social recovery)

**Note:** Succession planning is incomplete until wallet multisig is configured. This is a known vulnerability.
