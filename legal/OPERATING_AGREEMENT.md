The Company is a disregarded entity for federal income tax
purposes. All income, losses, deductions, and credits flow
through to the Member's personal tax return on Schedule C.

The Member may take distributions at any time, subject to:

  filing fees, infrastructure costs, API credits, and
  business expenses. These are the Member's funds.
- **House Treasury** — $HOUSEBERNARD tokens and associated
  reserves governed by the Constitution. These are NOT the
  Member's personal property. The Treasury is held in trust
  for the House and its citizens per Constitution Article VI
  (The Bernard Trust).

The Member may not commingle Treasury reserves with personal
funds. The Treasury engine (treasury_engine.py) is the
authoritative record of Treasury state.
