## Mark 1: HOUSE BERNARD

### Filing 1A — Class 42

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Mark** | HOUSE BERNARD |
| **Mark type** | Standard character mark |
| **Class** | 42 — Scientific and technological services |
| **Basis** | 1(a) Use in Commerce |
| **First use date** | February 9, 2026 |
| **First use in commerce date** | February 9, 2026 |

intelligence; Technological research in the field of artificial
intelligence; Computer software development; Research and
development of new products for others in the field of
artificial intelligence"

**Specimen:** Screenshot of the House Bernard GitHub repository
showing the HOUSE BERNARD mark in connection with AI research
software and documentation. The repository is publicly
accessible and demonstrates the mark's use in commerce through
the offering of AI research tools and governance software.

**Notes:** The GitHub repository with timestamped commits from
February 2026 establishes first use. The public availability
of the software and research outputs constitutes use in
commerce under the Lanham Act, even without revenue, because
the materials are offered to the public in connection with
described services.

| **Mark** | HOUSE BERNARD |

research and development; Downloadable computer software for
managing digital tokens and digital assets; Downloadable
computer software for data analysis and scientific research;

testing and validation"

**Notes:** File as Intent to Use (1(b)) since the downloadable

distributed as standalone packages. Convert to Use in Commerce
when software is publicly released for download. An additional
fee (~$100) applies at the Statement of Use stage.

as it is how the token is referenced in all governance
documents.

## Common-Law Protection (Active Now)

Even before federal registration, House Bernard has common-law
trademark rights through first use in commerce. Maintain the
following evidence:

- GitHub repository with timestamped commits (February 2026+)
- Google Cloud project registered to house.bernard.gov@gmail.com
- Tax filings showing business activity under "House Bernard"
- All governance documents with creation dates
- ENS domain registration (housebernard.eth)
- Social media accounts (@HouseBernard)
- This document and all constitutional records

Common-law rights are geographically limited but provide a
defense against later filers. Federal registration extends
protection nationwide.

---

## Defensive Monitoring (Post-Filing)

Once marks are filed, set up monitoring:

- **USPTO TESS searches** — monthly search for similar marks
  in Classes 42, 9, and 36
- **Google Alerts** — set alerts for "House Bernard" and
  "$HOUSEBERNARD"
- **Token registry monitoring** — check CoinMarketCap,
  CoinGecko, and Etherscan for unauthorized tokens using
  House Bernard branding
- **Domain monitoring** — check for squatting on
  housebernard.com, .io, .org, etc.

DEFENSE.md Part I (Identity Defense) already covers attack
vectors and incident response for brand protection.
