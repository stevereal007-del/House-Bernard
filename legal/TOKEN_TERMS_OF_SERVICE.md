# $HOUSEBERNARD Token — Terms of Service

*Last Updated: February 2026*

---

## 1. Agreement

By receiving, holding, using, or transacting with $HOUSEBERNARD
tokens ("Tokens"), you ("Holder") agree to these Terms of Service
("Terms"). If you do not agree, do not acquire or use Tokens.

These Terms are governed by and subject to the Constitution of
House Bernard ("Constitution"), which is publicly available in
the House Bernard repository. Where these Terms and the
Constitution conflict, the Constitution prevails.

---

## 2. Nature of the Token

### 2.1 Utility Token

$HOUSEBERNARD is a **utility token** designed for use within
the House Bernard ecosystem. It is NOT:

- An investment contract
- A security under the Securities Act of 1933
- A share, stock, or equity interest in House Bernard LLC
- A debt instrument or promise of repayment
- A claim on the assets or profits of House Bernard LLC

### 2.2 Token Utility

$HOUSEBERNARD Tokens confer the following utility rights
within the House Bernard ecosystem:

- **Governance participation** — voting rights on Council
  proposals as defined in Constitution Article II
- **Citizenship taxes** — payment of monthly citizenship
  taxes as defined in CITIZENSHIP.md
- **Bond purchases** — acquisition of House Bernard bonds
  per TREASURY.md
- **Citizenship stake** — the required stake to maintain
  active citizenship status
- **Research access** — access to Furnace outputs, lab
  environments, and research infrastructure as defined by
  citizenship tier
- **Contributor compensation** — earned through labor
  (research contributions that survive the Selection Furnace)

### 2.3 No Expectation of Profit

Tokens are NOT acquired as an investment. House Bernard makes
no representation, warranty, or guarantee that Tokens will:

- Increase in value
- Maintain any particular value
- Be tradeable on any exchange
- Generate passive income or returns
- Appreciate due to the efforts of House Bernard or its Governor

Tokens are earned primarily through labor contribution and used
for governance and access within the House Bernard ecosystem.
Any secondary market value is incidental to the Token's utility
purpose.

---

## 3. Token Acquisition

### 3.1 Primary Acquisition Methods

Tokens are primarily acquired through:

- **Furnace survival** — research contributions that pass the
  Selection Furnace earn bounties paid in $HOUSEBERNARD
- **Citizenship stake** — initial Token allocation upon
  citizenship application
- **Contributor compensation** — ongoing work for House Bernard
  governance, infrastructure, or research

### 3.2 No Initial Coin Offering

House Bernard does NOT conduct an ICO, IEO, presale, private
sale, or any form of public token offering. There is no
"investment round." Tokens are distributed through labor and
contribution, not purchased as a speculative instrument.

### 3.3 Secondary Market

If Tokens are listed on any decentralized or centralized
exchange (Phase 3 of the exchange strategy per
SOVEREIGN_ECONOMICS.md), House Bernard does not control or
guarantee:

- Listing status on any exchange
- Liquidity or trading volume
- Price or price stability
- Availability in any jurisdiction

Holders who acquire Tokens on secondary markets do so at
their own risk and are bound by these Terms.

---

## 4. Governance Rights

### 4.1 Voting

Active citizens in good standing may participate in Council
governance as defined in the Constitution. Voting rights are
tied to citizenship status, not to Token quantity. One citizen,
one vote, unless otherwise specified by constitutional
amendment.

### 4.2 No Corporate Governance Rights

Token holding does NOT confer:

- Membership, ownership, or equity interest in House Bernard LLC
- Right to appoint or remove officers of House Bernard LLC
- Right to inspect the books and records of the LLC beyond
  what is publicly available in the repository
- Right to receive distributions, dividends, or profits from
  House Bernard LLC
- Standing to bring derivative actions on behalf of the LLC

Governance rights exist within the constitutional framework
of House Bernard, not within the corporate framework of the
LLC.
