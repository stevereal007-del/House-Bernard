# Sovereign Economics — House Bernard

*Everything legal. Everything tracked. Everything above board.*

---

## I. Business Entity

### Current Structure

House Bernard operates as a sole proprietorship under HeliosBlade
(the Governor), filed on Schedule C against W-2 income from primary
employment. This is the simplest legal structure and appropriate
for the Founding Period.

### Planned Structure

File a single-member LLC in the Governor's home state:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Entity Name | House Bernard LLC |
| Type | Single-member LLC (disregarded entity for tax) |
| State | Governor's home state (New England) |
| Filing Fee | ~$120 |
| Registered Agent | HeliosBlade (self, or registered agent service) |
| EIN | Obtain from IRS (free, online, immediate) |
| Purpose | Artificial intelligence research, software development, digital asset management |

The LLC provides:
- Liability protection (personal assets separated from business)
- Legal entity to hold trademarks and intellectual property
- Recognized structure for eventual token issuance
- Professional credibility with exchanges, partners, and regulators

A single-member LLC files on Schedule C — same as a sole
proprietorship. No additional tax complexity. The LLC is a legal
wrapper, not a tax structure change.

**Timeline:** File the LLC and obtain EIN before the first
external transaction (contributor payment, token issuance, or
exchange listing).

## II. Trademarks

### Filing Strategy

File federal trademarks through the USPTO TEAS (Trademark
Electronic Application System). Each class costs $250-350.

| Mark | Class | Description | Priority |
|------|-------|-------------|----------|
| **House Bernard** | Class 42 | Scientific and technological services; AI research | File immediately |
| **House Bernard** | Class 9 | Downloadable software (OpenClaw, SAIF tools) | File with software release |
| **$HOUSEBERNARD** | Class 36 | Financial services; digital token management | File before token launch |
| **OpenClaw** | Class 42 | Software platform for AI agent research | File with public launch |
| **Selection Furnace** | Class 42 | Algorithmic testing and validation services | File when resources allow |

### Common-Law Protection (Active Now)

Even before federal registration, House Bernard has common-law
trademark rights through first use in commerce. Evidence of first
use:

- Tax filings showing business activity under "House Bernard"
- GitHub repository with timestamped commits
- Google Cloud project registered to house.bernard.gov@gmail.com
- Governance documents dated February 2026
- This document and all constitutional records

Maintain these records. They establish priority if anyone
challenges the marks.

### Defensive Monitoring

Once marks are filed, monitor for infringement. This is a future
task for the CPA Agent or a dedicated legal automation:

- Google Alerts for "House Bernard" in AI/crypto contexts
- USPTO TESS searches for similar filings
- Domain monitoring for housebernard.* registrations

## III. Tax Strategy

### Principles

1. **File honestly.** Report all income and expenses accurately.
2. **Deduct legitimately.** Every deduction has a receipt and a
   business purpose.
3. **Document everything.** The Ledger is the single source of
   truth for all financial activity.
4. **Pay what is owed.** No schemes, no shelters, no games.

### Tax Year 2026 (First Filing)

House Bernard was founded February 9, 2026. The 2026 tax year
is the first filing year.

**Filing method:** Schedule C attached to the Governor's personal
1040. Single-member LLC (when formed) is a disregarded entity —
same treatment.

**Expected status:** Net loss (pre-revenue, capital investment
phase).

### Deductible Expenses

| Category | Examples | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Hardware | Beelink EQ13, peripherals, storage | Section 179 or depreciate |
| Software | Anthropic API credits, Google Workspace, domain registrations | Subscription = current expense |
| Internet | Portion of home internet attributable to business | Calculate % of business use |
| Phone | Portion of phone bill (2FA, account management) | Calculate % of business use |
| Cloud Services | Google Cloud (if charges incurred) | Track actual charges |
| Legal | LLC filing, trademark applications | Current expense |
| Education | Technical books, courses directly related to AI research | Must be directly relevant |
| Office | Dedicated workspace in home (if applicable) | Home office deduction rules apply |

### Business Loss Rules

The IRS allows business losses to offset W-2 income on Schedule C.
The hobby loss rule applies: if the business shows losses for three
of five consecutive years, the IRS may reclassify it as a hobby.

**Defense against hobby classification:**
- Formal business plan (CONSTITUTION.md, VISION.md, TREASURY.md)
- Formal books and records (Treasury engine, Ledger)
- Businesslike conduct (governance framework, documented processes)
- Time and effort invested (documented development hours)
- Expectation of profit (token economics, contributor network growth)
- Advisory relationships (this document, CPA consultation)

**Recommendation:** Consult a CPA specializing in technology
startups before the first filing. Budget $300-500 for initial
consultation. The CPA validates the approach; the Treasury engine
maintains the records.

### Income Reporting

When House Bernard generates revenue (token sales, research
licensing, consulting), report all income on Schedule C. Sources:

| Income Type | Trigger | Reporting |
|-------------|---------|-----------|
| Token sales | $HOUSEBERNARD sold for USD/crypto | Fair market value at time of sale |
| Research licensing | External entity licenses Furnace genetics | Invoice amount |
| Consulting | House Bernard expertise engaged | Invoice amount |
| Interest/yield | Treasury bonds or reserve investments | Actual yield received |

### Contributor Tax Reporting

House Bernard is **not responsible** for contributors' personal
tax obligations. Contributors are independent participants, not
employees.

However, US tax law requires:

- **1099-NEC** issued to any US-based contributor receiving
  $600+ in USD-equivalent value in a calendar year
- **Fair market value** recorded for every bounty payment at
  the time of issuance
- **Records maintained** in the Ledger for all payments
  regardless of threshold

The Treasury engine must track:
- Recipient identity (wallet address + any KYC data for US persons)
- Payment amount in $HOUSEBERNARD
- USD-equivalent value at time of payment
- Date of payment
- Constitutional basis (which brief, which Furnace result)

**Contributors are advised** to consult their own tax professionals.
House Bernard provides records, not tax advice.

## IV. The $HOUSEBERNARD Token

### Nature of the Token

$HOUSEBERNARD is a sovereign utility currency issued by House
Bernard LLC. It is:

- **Earned** primarily through labor (research contributions
  that survive the Selection Furnace)
- **Used** within the House economy (citizenship stakes, taxes,
  bond purchases, governance participation)
- **Backed** by the intellectual property output of the Furnace
  (surviving artifacts, genetics, licensed research)
- **Governed** by the Constitution and Treasury rules, not by
  the discretion of any individual

### Token Allocation (from TREASURY.md)

| Allocation | Percentage | Governance |
|------------|-----------|------------|
| Unmined Treasury | 60% | Bounties, royalties, bonds, lab funding, founder vest, Bernard Trust |
| Liquidity Pool | 15% | Enables secondary market trading |
| Governor Reserve | 15% | Operational flexibility, partnerships, emergencies |
| Genesis Contributors | 10% | Early believers, initial Council members |

**Note:** Founder allocation (4-year vest) and Bernard Trust are
funded from the Unmined Treasury through documented constitutional
mechanisms — not as separate genesis allocations. This matches
TREASURY.md Section I, which is the canonical allocation authority.

### Exchange Strategy

**Phase 1 — Token deployed.** $HOUSEBERNARD exists as an SPL token
on Solana mainnet. Fixed supply, mint authority burned. Treasury
engine and CPA Agent track all internal allocations.

**Phase 2 — Decentralized exchange.** Listed on Raydium (Standard
AMM pool). Liquidity provided from the 15% liquidity allocation.
Anyone with a Phantom wallet can buy or sell. Price discovered
organically by the invisible hand.

**Phase 3 — Aggregator visibility.** Jupiter, Birdeye, DexScreener
index the Raydium pool automatically. CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap
listing applied for when trading volume justifies it.

**Phase 4 — Centralized exchanges.** If organic volume and
community demand justify it, pursue listing on centralized
exchanges. This requires the LLC entity, legal review, and
compliance documentation.

**The invisible hand determines the price.** House Bernard does
not manipulate, inflate, or suppress the token price. The value
comes from the work. If the Furnace produces valuable research,
the token has value. If it doesn't, it doesn't. That's honest.

### Constitutional Constraints on Trading

To prevent pump-and-dump exploitation:

- **Founder sale rate limit:** Already defined in TREASURY.md.
  Governor cannot dump allocation.
- **Large holder rate limit:** Any wallet holding more than 2%
  of total supply is limited to selling no more than 10% of
  their position per calendar month. Enforced in the smart
  contract.
- **Treasury reserve rules:** Reserve tokens cannot be sold
  without Council approval and documented justification.
- **Bernard Trust lock:** Trust tokens are non-transferable
  except for distributions to beneficiaries per Trust rules.
- **Transparency:** All large transactions (>0.5% of supply)
  are publicly logged in the Ledger with constitutional basis.

### Securities Law Considerations

The Howey Test determines whether a token is a security:
(1) investment of money, (2) in a common enterprise, (3) with
expectation of profits, (4) derived from the efforts of others.

**Mitigation strategy:**

- Token is primarily *earned*, not purchased
- Token has genuine utility (governance, taxes, access)
- No ICO, no presale, no "invest for returns" marketing
- Governance is progressively decentralized (Founding Period
  transition)
- The House's research output is produced by *contributors*,
  not a central team — decentralized effort

**Legal review required** before Phase 2 (token contract
deployment). Budget for a securities attorney consultation.
This is not optional.

## V. The House Bernard Banking System

### Purpose

Citizens need a secured financial system to hold, transact,
and manage their $HOUSEBERNARD holdings. This is not a bank
in the regulated sense — it is a constitutional treasury
management system operated by the House for the House.

### Architecture

**Citizen Wallets.** Every citizen receives a wallet upon
citizenship. The wallet is identity-linked through the Ledger.
It holds:

- $HOUSEBERNARD balance
- Earned royalty history
- Citizenship stake (held, not locked)
- Transaction history
- Bond holdings

**The Treasury Engine.** The existing treasury_engine.py is
extended to serve as the banking backend. It processes all
transactions under constitutional constraints:

- Bounty payments (automatic on Furnace survival)
- Royalty distributions (scheduled per ROYALTIES.md)
- Citizenship taxes (monthly, with hardship waivers)
- Bond purchases and yield payments
- Citizen-to-citizen transfers
- Exchange deposits and withdrawals (Phase 3+)

**Multi-Signature Governance.** Transactions above defined
thresholds require multiple signatures:

| Transaction Type | Threshold | Required Signatures |
|-----------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Routine bounty | Any amount | AchillesRun (automatic) |
| Royalty distribution | Any amount | AchillesRun (automatic, scheduled) |
| Reserve draw | Any amount | Governor + AchillesRun + 1 Council member |
| Emergency distribution | Any amount | Governor + Judiciary Chief + AchillesRun |
| Bond issuance | >1% of supply | Council majority + Governor |
| Smart contract update | Any change | Council supermajority + Judiciary review + Governor |

**Transparency Layer.** The Treasury state is published to
Google Sheets via the Sheets API. Any citizen can view:

- Total supply and circulating supply
- All wallet balances (pseudonymous)
- All transactions with constitutional basis
- Reserve holdings and diversification
- Bond outstanding and yield obligations

The Wardens audit the Treasury quarterly. Audit results are
published in the Ledger.

### Citizenship Stake Adjustment

The citizenship stake must not become a wealth barrier as
token value increases. The stake is defined as:

**1,000 $HOUSEBERNARD or the equivalent of 40 hours of
minimum-wage labor in the citizen's jurisdiction — whichever
is lower.**

This preserves skin in the game without pricing out
working-class participants. The Governor's working-class
origin is not decorative — it's a constitutional commitment
to accessibility.

Hardship waivers remain available for citizens who cannot
meet even the adjusted threshold.

### The CPA Agent

As the House economy grows, a dedicated agent — the CPA
Agent — manages financial operations:

- Monthly Treasury reconciliation
- Quarterly Warden audit preparation
- Annual tax document generation (1099s, Schedule C data)
- Real-time fair market value tracking for tax reporting
- Reserve diversification recommendations (subject to
  Council approval)
- Contributor payment records maintenance
- Exchange compliance documentation

The CPA Agent operates under the Agent's Code and is subject
to the same constitutional constraints as AchillesRun. It
reports to the Council on financial matters and to the
Wardens for audit purposes.

### Reserve Management

As $HOUSEBERNARD acquires real value, the Treasury reserve
requires active management:

| Reserve Component | Purpose | Governance |
|------------------|---------|------------|
| $HOUSEBERNARD holdings | Core reserve, governance weight | Constitutional rules |
| Stablecoin holdings | Operational expenses (servers, subscriptions, legal) | Council-approved budget |
| Fiat holdings | Tax obligations, filing fees, professional services | Governor discretion within budget |

**Reserve policy:** Maintain at minimum 12 months of
operational expenses in stablecoin or fiat. This ensures
House Bernard survives token price volatility. The Furnace
doesn't stop because the market is down.

## VII. What House Bernard Is NOT

House Bernard is not a bank. It does not accept deposits from
the public, make loans, or operate under a banking charter.

House Bernard is not an investment fund. $HOUSEBERNARD is not
marketed as an investment vehicle. No promises of returns are
made to anyone.

House Bernard is not a money transmitter. Internal token
transfers between citizens within a closed ecosystem are not
money transmission. If this changes (e.g., fiat on/off ramps),
legal review is required before proceeding.

House Bernard is not an employer. Contributors are independent
participants. No employment relationship exists. No benefits,
no withholding, no workers' compensation.

House Bernard IS a sovereign research institution with its own
currency, governance, and economic system — operating within
the legal frameworks of the jurisdictions where its citizens
reside.

## VIII. If It Fails

If House Bernard fails — if the research doesn't pan out, if the
token has no value, if the Furnace produces nothing worth keeping —
then the following happens:

1. All expenses were legitimately deducted against real income
2. All taxes were honestly filed
3. All trademarks were properly registered
4. All contributors were fairly compensated for work performed
5. All records exist in the Ledger, on GitHub, and in the
   Governor's tax filings
6. The Bernard Trust distributions, if any were made, were
   legitimate family support from a legitimate business

Nothing was hidden. Nothing was fraudulent. The invisible hand
determined the value, and the value was zero. That happens to
businesses every day. It is not a crime to try and fail. It is
not a crime to build something ambitious on nights and weekends
from a mini-PC in New England.

We did our best.
