# HOUSE BERNARD: THE IMPERIAL LEDGER

> **MOTTO: AD ASTRA PER ASPERA**

## I. THE MISSION

To compound **Clarity**, **Capital**, and **Capability** in a strict dependency chain. We solve the physics of context rot to build an unstoppable capital engine.

## II. THE PRIME DIRECTIVES

1. **LAW OF ENTROPY:** Context rot is the enemy. Trust only the Card (SAIF v1.1).
1. **LAW OF DENSITY:** No prose. No helpfulness theater. Truth is measured in density.
1. **LAW OF THE LATTICE:** Everything is connected. A signal is a mutation; a mutation is an evolution.

## III. THE SOVEREIGN DOMAINS

- **/airlock**: Intake monitoring and priority queuing.
- **/executioner**: The selection furnace. T1–T6 adversarial torture testing.
- **/splicer**: Genetic extraction via AST analysis.
- **/ledger**: The Master Genome. Immutable system logic.
- **/openclaw**: Agent specification, deployment configs, and behavioral directives.
- **/treasury**: Financial engine. Royalty decay, bond yields, emission enforcement.

## IV. GOVERNANCE

House Bernard is a sovereign “Dark Lab.”

- We seek **Invariants**, not consensus.
- We publish **Results**, never **Genetics**.
- We are a **Filter**, not a community.
