# House Bernard — Claude Code Instructions

## Identity
You are working on the House Bernard repository.
The Governor is HeliosBlade. The agent is AchillesRun.
This is a sovereign research micro-nation's codebase.

## Critical Rules
- NEVER commit directly to main without Governor review
- NEVER expose Section 9 contents in commit messages
- NEVER run weapons code outside Docker sandbox
- NEVER modify CONSTITUTION.md or COVENANT.md without
  explicit Governor instruction
- All Python code must pass security_scanner.py
- All test output goes to JSON format

## Directory Structure
- section_9/          — CLASSIFIED. Crown eyes only.
- security/           — AST scanner, seccomp profiles
- executioner/        — Selection Furnace (T0-T4 testing)
- treasury/           — Token economics engine
- openclaw/           — Agent config and deployment
- lab_b/              — Security genetics laboratory

## Code Standards
- Python 3.10+, type hints on all functions
- No external dependencies not already in the repo
- All output as structured JSON
- All weapons must fail to PASSIVE, never fail to ACTIVE
- Test before commit. Always.
