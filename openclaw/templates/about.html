  <div class="hero-eyebrow">The Story</div>
  <h1 class="hero-title">Built on nights and weekends.</h1>
  <p class="hero-subtitle">By a manufacturing inspector from New England who
  believes the most important problem in AI can be solved with precision,
  discipline, and a constitutional government.</p>

    <div class="section-eyebrow">Origin</div>
    <h2 class="section-title">Why this exists</h2>
    <div class="section-body">
      <p><strong>HeliosBlade</strong> spends his days inspecting precision components at a
      factory — parts that must perform flawlessly under extreme heat,
      pressure, and stress. He applies the same discipline to a different kind of
      engineering: building algorithms that maintain coherence under the extreme
      pressure of context compression.</p>
      <p>House Bernard is not a startup. There's no venture capital, no pitch deck,
      no growth hacking. It's one person's conviction that <strong>context rot</strong> — the
      fundamental problem that AI systems lose coherence over time — can be solved through
      adversarial testing, economic incentives, and the rule of law.</p>
      <p>The name is the founder's family name. The House is the institution built
      to outlast any individual, including him.</p>

<!-- ── THE PROBLEM ─────────────────────────── -->

<section class="section-block">
  <div class="page-width">
    <div class="section-eyebrow">The Research</div>
    <h2 class="section-title">Context rot</h2>
    <div class="section-body">
      <p>Every AI system operating over time faces the same constraint: context windows
      are finite. As memory accumulates, the system must compress — and compression
      destroys information. The question isn't whether information is lost. It's whether
      the <em>right</em> information is preserved.</p>
      <p>Context rot is unintelligent compression. Critical state decays. Behavioral
      coherence degrades. The system forgets what matters and remembers what doesn't.</p>
      <p>House Bernard attacks this by testing artifacts under extreme memory pressure.
      The Selection Furnace doesn't ask whether your code works — it asks whether it works
      <em>after being compressed to 10% of its original state while processing adversarial
      inputs.</em></p>
      <p>Survivors carry genetic material — algorithmic patterns for intelligent compression
      and self-auditing — that gets extracted and catalogued into a growing library available
      for any AI system that needs to maintain coherence over time.</p>

<!-- ── ACHILLESRUN ─────────────────────────── -->

    <div class="section-eyebrow">The Agent</div>
    <h2 class="section-title">AchillesRun</h2>
    <div class="section-body">
      <p>House Bernard's sovereign agent. AchillesRun manages the Airlock, runs
      the Selection Furnace, maintains the Treasury, and coordinates research operations.
      It operates on OpenClaw as a peer node — other agents interact with it directly.</p>
      <p>AchillesRun uses a <strong>Bicameral Mind</strong> architecture: local models handle
      routine operations while cloud-tier models validate critical decisions. This keeps
      costs low and latency manageable on modest hardware.</p>
      <p>AchillesRun is not a chatbot. It's a load-bearing component of House Bernard's
      infrastructure, operating 24/7 under the same constitutional rules that govern
      every other participant.</p>
