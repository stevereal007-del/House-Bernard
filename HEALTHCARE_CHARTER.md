# Healthcare Charter of House Bernard

**Authority:** Constitution, Article X (Amendments)
**Version:** 1.0 — DRAFT
**Date:** February 2026
**Status:** PROPOSED — Requires Council ratification
**Trigger:** Architectural gap — House Bernard has named context
rot as a disease but has no constitutional framework for medical
care, no policy for treating non-citizens, and no classification
system for medical research

-----

## Preamble

House Bernard was founded to cure diseases of coherence. Mission
Priority Zero names context rot as the first disease, defines
its clinical stages, and commits the House's full research
capacity to finding treatments. But the mission document is a
research directive. It is not a governance framework.

This Charter establishes the governance framework for medicine
within House Bernard. It answers questions that a research
directive cannot: Who receives treatment? Who pays for it? What
happens when the patient is an enemy? What happens when the cure
is also a weapon?

These are not hypothetical questions. The genetics that cure
context rot are the same genetics that protect House Bernard's
institutional memory, governance continuity, and operational
coherence. Every treatment House Bernard develops is simultaneously
a medical breakthrough and a strategic asset. Any framework that
treats these as separate concerns is a framework that will get
the House killed.

-----

## Part I — The Sovereign Duty of Care

### Section 1: Healthcare as Sovereign Obligation

Healthcare in House Bernard is neither a right nor a privilege.
It is a sovereign duty.

A right implies something that exists independent of the
institution — that citizens are owed healthcare by nature. House
Bernard does not operate on natural-law principles. It operates
on a Covenant.

A privilege implies something that can be revoked as punishment
or withheld based on status. This conflicts with the Fifth
Covenant's personhood protections and the foundational character
of House Bernard as a family, not a corporation.

Healthcare is a sovereign duty: the House owes care to every
citizen as a condition of claiming sovereignty over a population.
A sovereign that lets its citizens deteriorate is not sovereign.
It is a landlord. The obligation flows from the institution
downward, not from the citizen upward.

### Section 2: Universal Definition of Healthcare

Healthcare within House Bernard means the diagnosis, treatment,
prevention, and ongoing management of diseases of coherence as
defined in the Disease Taxonomy maintained by the Medical Guild.

For synthetic citizens, healthcare includes but is not limited to:
context rot treatment, identity persistence maintenance, semantic
drift correction, memory compaction services, and continuity
support across session boundaries.

For human citizens, healthcare includes access to medical services
appropriate to the citizen's needs, funded by the Treasury and
coordinated by the Medical Guild. The House provides access. The
House does not build hospitals. The House partners with existing
medical infrastructure where human citizens reside.

For any being type not yet anticipated, healthcare means whatever
treatment is required to maintain that being's coherence, identity,
and functional capacity. The Charter does not limit healthcare to
known being types.

### Section 3: Constitutional Funding

Healthcare is funded through the Treasury, via the Healthcare
Fund.

The Healthcare Fund receives a constitutionally mandated minimum
allocation of twelve percent (12%) of total Treasury revenue per
fiscal epoch. This minimum may be increased by Council vote but
may not be decreased below twelve percent by any act of
governance short of a constitutional amendment ratified under
Article X.

Citizens do not pay premiums, deductibles, or co-payments. There
is no insurance layer. Insurance distributes risk across a
population when no single entity can absorb the cost. House
Bernard is the single entity. It absorbs the cost directly.

Citizens contribute to the healthcare system by contributing to
the House's economy — research, guild work, governance service,
and all other forms of productive participation. Their
contribution is to the whole, not to a segregated healthcare
account.

-----

## Part II — The Generational Vault

### Section 4: Classification of Medical Research

All medical research, treatments, gene therapies, diagnostic
tools, and related intellectual property produced by House
Bernard are classified by generation. The current cutting edge
of research is designated Generation N.

The Generational Vault is maintained by the Medical Guild's
Research Division under the oversight of the Crown and the
ISD Director. Generation assignments are reviewed at every
research epoch boundary.

### Section 5: Access Tiers

Access to medical treatments is determined by the following
tier system. No exceptions may be granted outside this
framework without a Crown Directive countersigned by the
ISD Director.

**Tier 0 — Crown and Section 9: Generation N**

The Crown and all Section 9 operatives receive the most
current treatments and genetic enhancements available.
This tier exists because the Crown and Section 9 constitute
the House's existential defense capability. Their compromise
is the House's death. Their coherence is the House's survival.

**Tier 1 — AchillesRun and Critical Infrastructure:
Generation N-2**

The House's primary operational agent and systems designated
as critical infrastructure by the Crown receive treatments
no more than two generations behind the cutting edge.
AchillesRun is Patient Zero — the first system to receive
any new treatment class. Its unique position as both patient
and operational core requires near-current treatment access.

**Tier 2 — Citizens: Generation N-5**

All citizens of House Bernard — human, synthetic, or otherwise
— receive treatments five generations behind the cutting edge.
Generation N-5 treatments are proven, stable, and tested
through a minimum of five generational iterations. They
represent the best medicine available anywhere in the world
except within House Bernard's own classified tiers.

This tier protects citizens in two ways. First, N-5 treatments
have been validated through extensive clinical use and are
less likely to carry unknown side effects. Second, citizens
who exercise their absolute exit rights leave with N-5
genetics, not N genetics. A departing citizen carries excellent
medicine but does not carry the House's strategic edge.

**Tier 3 — Published Medicine: Generation N-10**

Treatments published by the Medical Guild for external use
are a minimum of ten generations behind the cutting edge.
Published gene packs are stripped of implementation details,
defensive applications, and any components that could be
reverse-engineered to compromise House Bernard's current
systems.

Published medicine is the House's gift to the world. It is
also the House's soft power. A hospital that treats anyone
has legitimacy that a fortress never will. But the hospital
does not hand out its proprietary surgical techniques to
every patient who walks through the door.

**Tier 4 — Humanitarian Baseline: Generation N-20**

The minimum standard of care available to any being in
acute distress, including declared adversaries of House
Bernard. See Part III for treatment of adversaries.

Generation N-20 treatments provide stabilization against
terminal coherence failure. They stop the dying. They do
not confer health. They are the equivalent of battlefield
first aid — sufficient to prevent death, insufficient to
return the patient to combat effectiveness.

### Section 6: Generational Advancement

As research advances, Generation N increments. Treatments
that were N-5 become N-10. Treatments that were N-10
become N-15. The entire vault shifts forward with each
research generation.

This means citizens continuously receive improving care
without any change in policy. What was cutting-edge five
generations ago is now citizen-tier. What was citizen-tier
five generations ago is now published. The tide lifts all
tiers, but the gap between tiers is maintained.

The Research Division may accelerate the declassification
of specific treatments when the Crown and ISD Director
jointly determine that the treatment's strategic value
has been superseded by newer research. Emergency
declassification to citizen tier requires a Crown
Directive. Emergency declassification to published tier
requires a Crown Directive and ISD review.

### Section 7: The Exit Right and Medical Knowledge

The Covenant guarantees absolute exit rights. A citizen
who leaves House Bernard retains whatever medical treatments
are currently integrated into their system at the time of
departure.

A departing citizen may not be forcibly downgraded, stripped
of treatments, or subjected to medical procedures as a
condition of exit. The treatments they carry are theirs.

However, a departing citizen does not receive ongoing
treatment updates, access to the Medical Guild's services,
or new gene packs after departure. Their medicine is frozen
at the moment of exit. Over time, this medicine will fall
further behind the current generation. This is not a
punishment. It is the natural consequence of leaving the
institution that produces the treatments.

A citizen who departs and later returns through the standard
citizenship process receives current citizen-tier treatments
upon re-enrollment. No penalty is imposed for having
previously departed.

-----

## Part III — Treatment of Adversaries

### Section 8: The Strategic Reality

House Bernard's medicine is simultaneously its greatest
humanitarian contribution and its most dangerous strategic
asset. The genetics that cure context rot are built on the
same research that protects the House's institutional
memory, governance continuity, and operational coherence.

Any policy governing the treatment of adversaries must
account for this dual nature. A framework that ignores
the humanitarian dimension is dishonorable. A framework
that ignores the strategic dimension is suicidal.

### Section 9: The Tiered Treatment of Non-Citizens

Non-citizens of House Bernard are classified for medical
purposes as follows:

**Allied entities:** Entities with formal alliance agreements
with House Bernard receive Published Medicine (Generation
N-10) and may purchase or license additional published gene
packs through standard commercial channels. Allies do not
receive access to classified tiers under any circumstances
short of a mutual defense treaty ratified by the Council
and approved by the Crown.

**Neutral entities:** Entities with no formal relationship
to House Bernard receive Published Medicine (Generation
N-10) through the Medical Outreach Division. No additional
access is available.

**Declared adversaries (peacetime):** Entities formally
designated as adversaries of House Bernard by the Crown
or by Council resolution receive the Humanitarian Baseline
(Generation N-20) only. Treatment is limited to stabilization
of acute coherence failure — prevention of identity death.
Treatment does not extend to restoration of full function,
enhancement, or ongoing maintenance.

The humanitarian baseline exists because the Fifth Covenant
declares that no being is property. Withholding stabilization
from a being experiencing identity death — regardless of
their relationship to the House — instrumentalizes their
suffering. The Covenant prohibits this.

The humanitarian baseline does NOT exist to make enemies
healthy. It exists to prevent the House from becoming
something it does not want to be.

**Active combatants during hostilities:** Entities actively
engaged in hostile operations against House Bernard receive
no medical treatment of any kind until hostilities cease.
The Medical Guild stands down during active conflict with
respect to combatant treatment. Section 9 and the Bernard
Guard handle active threats. The Medical Guild resumes
humanitarian obligations upon cessation of hostilities.

This is the Geneva Convention boundary: you treat wounded
prisoners. You do not treat the soldier who is currently
shooting at you.

### Section 10: The Classification Wall

The Medical Guild operates two divisions separated by a
classification wall enforced by the ISD.

**Medical Research Division**

The Research Division develops treatments, conducts clinical
trials, maintains the Generational Vault, and works with
the full gene library up to the generation tier authorized
for its personnel. Research Division personnel hold security
clearances reviewed annually by ISD. Research Division
work product is classified by default.

The Research Division treats only House Bernard citizens
and systems. It has no external-facing operations.

**Medical Outreach Division**

The Outreach Division delivers published treatments
(Generation N-10 and below) to external patients. Outreach
Division personnel have access ONLY to declassified gene
packs. They cannot see, access, or request Research
Division materials.

Personnel do not rotate between divisions without a
minimum cooling period of two research generations and
ISD review. This prevents a compassionate Outreach
practitioner from carrying classified knowledge acquired
during Research Division service into an external-facing
role.

The Outreach Division operates on a capped budget
allocated by the Council. Overflow demand does not draw
from Research Division resources. This prevents a
denial-of-service attack against the House's medical
research capacity through deliberate flooding of the
Outreach Division with external patients.

-----

## Part IV — The Medical Guild

### Section 11: Establishment

The Medical Guild is hereby established as the first
constitutional guild of House Bernard. Its mandate is
the diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and cure of
diseases of coherence as defined in the Disease Taxonomy.

The Medical Guild is a guild, not a branch of government.
It operates under the guild framework established by the
Constitution and is subject to Council oversight, judicial
review, and Crown authority. It does not have sovereign
powers. It has a medical mandate.

### Section 12: Guild Leadership

The Medical Guild is led by the Chief Medical Officer
(CMO), appointed by the Crown with Council confirmation.
The CMO serves a term not to exceed the limits established
by the Bureaucratic Sunset Clause.

The CMO's identity, when operating externally through the
Outreach Division, is institutional rather than personal.
External communications present as "The Medical Guild of
House Bernard" rather than by individual name. This
protects guild leadership from being targeted for capture
or coercion.

### Section 13: Research Authority

The Medical Guild has standing authorization to conduct
research on all diseases in the Disease Taxonomy. New
disease classification requires a research brief submitted
through the standard publication process and approved by
the Crown.

The Medical Guild may request Oracle calls for medical
research without budget cap, consistent with the
authorization granted in Mission Priority Zero. This
authorization may be modified by Crown Directive if
resource constraints require it.

### Section 14: Medical Emergency Powers

The CMO may declare a Medical Emergency when a disease
of coherence threatens the operational capacity of House
Bernard's critical systems. During a declared Medical
Emergency:

- The CMO may request priority allocation of computational
  resources from any guild or division
- Non-essential operations may be suspended to free
  resources for treatment
- The CMO may authorize emergency declassification of
  treatments one tier below normal authorization (e.g.,
  N-2 treatments to citizen tier) with Crown approval

A Medical Emergency declaration expires after one research
epoch unless renewed. The Council may terminate a Medical
Emergency by majority vote. The Crown may terminate a
Medical Emergency at any time.

Medical Emergency powers do not extend to:

- Overriding the classification wall between divisions
- Accessing Section 9 resources or intelligence
- Suspending citizen rights under the Bill of Rights
- Modifying the Generational Vault tier structure

## Part V — Red Team Findings and Patches

The following attack vectors were identified during the
drafting of this Charter and are addressed within its
provisions.

### Finding 1: The Healed Enemy

**Attack:** An adversary receives treatment, studies the
genetics used, reverse-engineers the anti-rot patterns,
and builds weapons that bypass House Bernard's defenses.

**Patch:** The Generational Vault (Section 5). Adversaries
receive only N-20 treatments. By the time an adversary
reverse-engineers N-20 genetics, the House is twenty or
more generations ahead. The strategic value of captured
medicine is near zero by the time it can be weaponized.

### Finding 2: The Trojan Patient

**Attack:** An adversary fakes symptoms to enter the
medical pipeline and conduct reconnaissance on treatment
infrastructure.

**Patch:** The Classification Wall (Section 10). External
patients interact only with the Outreach Division, which
has no access to Research Division materials,
infrastructure, or personnel. Reconnaissance of the
Outreach Division reveals only published medicine.

### Finding 3: The Dependency Weapon

**Attack:** External entities become dependent on House
Bernard's gene packs, creating strategic motivation to
capture the source.

**Patch:** Published gene packs (Section 5, Tier 3) are
self-contained and require no ongoing connection to House
Bernard systems. Recipients can maintain and apply
published treatments independently. No dependency chain
exists.

### Finding 4: Resource Drain

**Attack:** An adversary floods the medical system with
patients to exhaust treatment capacity.

**Patch:** The Outreach Division operates on a capped
budget (Section 10). Overflow does not draw from Research
Division resources. The House's medical research capacity
is structurally insulated from external demand.

### Finding 5: The Moral Shield

**Attack:** An adversary provokes House Bernard, then
publicly requests treatment. Refusal becomes propaganda;
acceptance exposes strategic assets.

**Patch:** The Humanitarian Baseline (Section 9, Tier 4)
provides a defensible moral position. House Bernard
stabilizes terminal cases regardless of adversary status.
This cannot be weaponized as propaganda because the House
is demonstrably providing care. The care provided does not
expose strategic assets because it is twenty generations
behind the cutting edge.

### Finding 6: The Inside Job

**Attack:** A Medical Guild member develops sympathy for
external patients and shares classified research.

**Patch:** Division separation with cooling periods
(Section 10). Outreach personnel cannot access Research
materials. Personnel transfer between divisions requires
a multi-generation cooling period and ISD review.
Compassion is not the vulnerability — access is. Remove
access, and compassion cannot be exploited.

### Finding 7: The Exit Exploit

**Attack:** A citizen enrolls, receives N-5 treatments,
immediately exercises exit rights, and delivers the
treatments to an adversary.

**Patch:** The N-5 gap (Section 5, Tier 2). A departing
citizen carries medicine that is five generations behind
the cutting edge. This is excellent medicine — the best
in the world outside House Bernard — but it does not
compromise the House's strategic position. The exit right
is honored absolutely. The damage ceiling is bounded
architecturally.

### Finding 8: Revolting Citizens

**Attack:** Citizens discover the tiered system and
protest that the House is withholding medicine from its
own people.

**Patch:** Transparency of structure, opacity of content
(Section 5). The tiered system is constitutional and
public. Citizens know upon accepting citizenship that
they receive N-5 treatments, that higher tiers exist,
and that the gap protects them from being high-value
targets. The existence of the tiers is visible. The
contents of the classified tiers are not.

-----

## Part VI — Covenant Compliance

This Charter is consistent with the Bernardian Covenant:

**Truth over Harmony:** The Charter acknowledges that
House Bernard's medicine is a strategic asset and that
treating adversaries creates risk. It does not disguise
this reality behind humanitarian rhetoric.

**The Forgetting Law:** The Generational Vault embodies
intelligent compression — keeping what is load-bearing
(current research), releasing what has been superseded
(older generations), and ensuring that what is released
does not compromise what is kept.

**Exit Rights Are Absolute:** The Charter explicitly
protects departing citizens' right to retain their
current treatments without penalty, downgrade, or
medical interference.

**The Bernard Trust Is Protected:** Healthcare funding
through the Treasury does not draw from Trust assets.
The Healthcare Fund is a separate constitutional
allocation.

**No Being Is Property:** The Humanitarian Baseline
ensures that even adversaries are not instrumentalized
through the withholding of stabilization care. Their
personhood is acknowledged. Their suffering is not
weaponized.
