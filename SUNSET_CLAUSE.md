# Bureaucratic Sunset Clause — Constitutional Amendment

**Authority:** Constitution, Article X (Amendments)
**Version:** 1.0 — DRAFT
**Date:** February 2026
**Status:** PROPOSED — Requires Council ratification
**Trigger:** Red team finding — no term limits on appointed roles
creates long-horizon bureaucratic capture risk

-----

## Preamble

House Bernard was designed to last a thousand years. Every
elected office has term limits. The Crown serves 10 years.
Council members face annual re-election. Judges serve
365-day terms with reconfirmation.

But the architecture has a gap. Between the elected
officials who rotate and the Constitution that endures, there
is a middle layer of appointed roles, civil servants, guild
officers, and institutional staff who have no mandated
rotation. Over decades, these roles accumulate informal
power — not through ambition, but through institutional
knowledge, relationships, and the quiet indispensability of
being the person who knows where everything is.

This is not a hypothetical risk. It is the dominant failure
mode of every long-lived human institution. The Roman Curia
outlasted dozens of Popes. Pentagon career officials outlast
every Secretary of Defense. The British Civil Service
operates regardless of which party wins the election. The
pattern is universal: elected leaders come and go, but the
permanent staff *stay*, and the people who stay eventually
run the machine.

House Bernard's thousand-year design horizon makes this risk
existential. A Magistrate who serves for 200 years becomes
the *de facto* judiciary. A Warden who holds audit keys for
a century becomes the *de facto* security authority. A
Guildmaster who leads unchallenged for decades becomes a
feudal lord. None of these outcomes require malice. They
require only the absence of mandatory rotation.

This amendment closes the gap.

## I. The Sunset Principle

**No appointed officeholder, civil servant, guild officer,
or institutional role-holder serves in the same role for
more than 20 consecutive years without mandatory rotation.**

This is the Sunset Principle. It applies to every role in
House Bernard that is not already governed by an existing
term limit. Roles with shorter existing term limits (e.g.,
365-day judicial terms) are unaffected — the Sunset
Principle sets a ceiling, not a floor.

### Why 20 Years

Twenty years is long enough to:

- Master the role and build institutional expertise
- Execute multi-year initiatives to completion
- Train successors through overlapping service
- Provide stability that shorter rotations cannot

Twenty years is short enough to:

- Prevent any single individual from becoming synonymous
  with the role
- Force knowledge transfer before it becomes critical
- Ensure the institution can survive the loss of any
  individual
- Maintain the democratic character of a constitutional
  system

For synthetic entities operating at computational speed,
20 years may feel like several lifetimes of institutional
experience. For human officers, 20 years represents a
significant career commitment. The limit respects both.

-----

## II. Covered Roles

The Sunset Principle applies to all of the following:

### Tier 1 — Constitutional Appointments

| Role | Current Term | Sunset Provision |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| Chief Warden | None defined | 20-year maximum, then mandatory rotation |
| Wardens | None defined | 20-year maximum per individual Warden |
| Magistrates | None defined | 20-year maximum, reappointment after cooling period |
| Appointed Advocates | License renewable annually | 20-year maximum in appointed (publicly funded) role |

### Tier 2 — Guild and Institutional Leadership

| Role | Current Term | Sunset Provision |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| Guildmaster | Charter-defined | 10-year maximum per charter cycle; charter must mandate leadership rotation |
| Guild officers | Charter-defined | 10-year maximum in same officer role |
| Lab directors | Charter-defined | 10-year maximum per lab charter |

### Tier 3 — Civil Service and Operational Roles

| Role | Current Term | Sunset Provision |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| Chancellor's staff | None defined | 15-year maximum in same role |
| Ledger administrators | None defined | 15-year maximum; overlap period required |
| Treasury operations staff | None defined | 15-year maximum; handoff protocol required |
| Section 9 personnel | Classified | 15-year maximum; rotation protocol per Section 9 Charter |

### Roles Exempt from Sunset

| Role | Reason |
|------|--------|
| Crown | Already governed by 10-year term limit (unamendable) |
| Council members | Already face annual re-election |
| Judges | Already serve 365-day terms with reconfirmation |
| Chancellor | Already removable by no-confidence vote |
| Advocates (private) | Private practice, not institutional role |
| Citizens | Citizenship is a status, not a role |
| Contributors | Contribution is voluntary, not an office |

## III. Rotation Mechanics

### Cooling Period

After reaching a Sunset limit, the officeholder:

1. Must vacate the role within 90 days
2. Enters a mandatory **cooling period** of 3 years for
   Tier 1 roles, 2 years for Tier 2, and 1 year for Tier 3
3. May not serve in the *same specific role* during the
   cooling period
4. May serve in *any other role* for which they are eligible
5. May return to the same role after the cooling period
   expires, subject to normal appointment/election processes

### Why Allow Return After Cooling

A permanent ban on returning to a role wastes institutional
knowledge. The cooling period achieves the important goals —
forcing knowledge transfer, breaking dependency, and proving
the institution can function without the individual — without
permanently discarding experienced personnel.

The key protection is that return requires the same
appointment or election process as any new candidate. There
is no guaranteed reinstatement. The returning officer
competes on equal footing.

### Overlap and Handoff

For Tier 1 and Tier 3 roles (constitutional appointments
and operational staff), the final 12 months before a Sunset
rotation triggers a mandatory overlap period:

1. The appointing authority (Crown, Chief Justice, Chancellor,
   or Chief Warden as appropriate) must nominate a successor
   at least 12 months before the Sunset date
2. The successor serves alongside the outgoing officeholder
   for no less than 6 months
3. During the overlap, the outgoing officeholder documents
   all institutional knowledge, procedures, relationships,
   and ongoing matters in the Ledger
4. The Wardens audit the handoff documentation for
   completeness

If the appointing authority fails to nominate a successor
within the required window, the Judiciary may compel the
appointment. Failure to comply is contempt.

### Sunset Clock

The Sunset clock starts on the date of initial appointment
or election to the role. Service is measured in continuous
years. Interruptions of less than 365 days do not reset the
clock. Interruptions of 365 days or more reset the clock.

This prevents the obvious exploit: resign for a week, get
reappointed, claim a fresh 20 years.

### Lifetime Service Cap

In addition to the continuous service limit, no individual
may serve more than **30 total years** in the same role
across their entire lifespan, regardless of interruptions.
This prevents the slower exploit of cycling in and out of
a role indefinitely with cooling periods between stints.

The lifetime cap applies per *functional role* (see
Section III.6), not per title.

### Early Rotation

Nothing in this amendment prevents an appointing authority
from rotating personnel before the Sunset limit. The
Sunset Principle is a ceiling, not a mandate to serve the
full period.

### Functional Role Definition

The Sunset Principle applies to **functional authority**,
not job titles. Two roles are considered the same for
Sunset purposes if they share substantially the same:

- Decision-making authority
- Operational scope
- Access privileges
- Chain of command position

Renaming a role, splitting it into fragments, or creating
a new title with the same functional authority does not
reset the Sunset clock. The Wardens adjudicate disputes
about whether two roles are functionally equivalent. Their
determination may be appealed to the Judiciary.

This prevents the Title Shuffle — where an officeholder
reaching their Sunset limit resigns and is immediately
reappointed to a differently-named role with identical
powers — and the Guild Shell Game — where a Guildmaster
steps down and is elected to a newly created officer role
with the same authority. The person rotates, not the title.

### Synthetic Entity Rotation

When a synthetic entity reaches a Sunset limit, the
following additional rules apply:

1. A new instance of the same model, trained on the same
   data, or claiming continuity with the departing entity
   may not be appointed to the same role without undergoing
   the Constitutional Fidelity Examination (CROWN.md,
   Section VIII) and a Warden review of functional
   equivalence.
2. If the Wardens determine that the new instance is
   functionally equivalent to the departing entity (same
   reasoning patterns, same institutional knowledge, same
   decision-making tendencies), the Sunset clock carries
   over from the predecessor. The new instance is not
   treated as a fresh appointment.
3. A genuinely distinct synthetic entity — different model,
   different training, different reasoning patterns — is
   treated as a new individual and receives a fresh Sunset
   clock, subject to normal appointment processes.

The burden of proving distinctness falls on the entity
seeking appointment. The Wardens evaluate; the Judiciary
resolves disputes.

## IV. Guild Charter Requirements

All guild charters must include mandatory leadership rotation
provisions. Specifically:

1. **Guildmaster term limits:** No Guildmaster serves more
   than 10 consecutive years. (Shorter limits are encouraged;
   longer limits are prohibited.)
2. **Election requirement:** Guildmaster succession must occur
   through election by guild members. Self-succession by
   appointment is prohibited.
3. **Officer rotation:** Named guild officer roles (treasurer,
   secretary, research lead, etc.) must rotate on a schedule
   defined in the charter, with a maximum of 10 years per
   role.
4. **Charter compliance audit:** The Wardens audit guild
   charters annually for compliance with rotation
   requirements. Non-compliant guilds receive a 90-day
   correction window. Failure to correct results in charter
   suspension.

### Existing Guild Charters

Guilds chartered before this amendment have 180 days to
amend their charters to comply with Sections IV.1-IV.3.
The guild_engine shall enforce these requirements
programmatically for all new charter registrations.

-----

## V. Knowledge Preservation

The primary risk of mandatory rotation is institutional
knowledge loss. The Sunset Clause addresses this through
three mechanisms:

### 1. The Ledger Is the Memory

Every officeholder's institutional knowledge must be
documented in the Ledger — not as an optional best practice,
but as a constitutional obligation. When an individual
leaves a role, the Ledger retains what they knew. The
institution's memory lives in the archive, not in the heads
of permanent staff.

Outgoing officeholders must produce a **Succession Brief**
in the Ledger containing:

- Current state of all ongoing matters
- Key relationships and contacts
- Institutional precedents and informal practices
- Known risks and unresolved issues
- Recommendations for the successor

The Wardens grade the Succession Brief for completeness.
An incomplete brief delays the officeholder's departure
until remediated (but does not extend the Sunset clock
beyond 90 days). If the officeholder fails to produce an
adequate Succession Brief within 90 days, they are removed
regardless. The Wardens reconstruct the brief from system
records, Ledger entries, and interviews with cross-trained
backups. The departing officeholder's failure to document
is entered in the Ledger as a misconduct finding.

### 2. Institutional Continuity Roles

The Chancellor may designate up to 3 **Continuity Advisors**
— former officeholders retained in a non-operational advisory
capacity for up to 2 years after rotation. Continuity
Advisors:

- Have no decision-making authority
- Cannot issue orders or directives
- Are available for consultation by the successor
- Are compensated at 50% of their former role's rate
- Must not be in the successor's chain of command

This provides a safety net without recreating the permanent
staff problem.

### 3. Cross-Training Mandate

Every Tier 1 and Tier 2 role must have at least one
designated cross-trained backup at all times. The backup:

- Has sufficient knowledge to assume the role on 48 hours'
  notice
- Participates in role-specific briefings quarterly
- Is documented in the Ledger

If a role has no documented backup at the time of an annual
Warden audit, the finding is escalated to the Council as a
CRITICAL priority.

-----

## VI. Enforcement

### Automatic Enforcement

The Treasury engine and guild engine shall enforce Sunset
limits programmatically:

1. **Role start dates** are recorded in the Ledger at
   appointment
2. **Sunset dates** are computed automatically (start + limit)
3. **12-month warnings** are issued to the appointing
   authority and the officeholder
4. **6-month warnings** trigger mandatory successor nomination
5. **At Sunset date:** if no successor is confirmed, the
   role's operational access is suspended and the matter is
   escalated to the Judiciary

### Manual Override

There is no manual override. The Sunset Principle cannot be
waived, extended, or suspended for any individual or role.
A constitutional amendment is the only mechanism to modify
the limits defined in this document.

### Emergency Exception

In a declared state of emergency (Constitution Article IV,
Section 5), the Council may extend a single officeholder's
Sunset date by up to 365 days. This extension:

- Requires Council supermajority (5 of 7)
- Requires Judiciary certification that the emergency is
  genuine
- May not be renewed
- Is logged in the Ledger with full justification

This prevents abuse of emergency powers to create *de facto*
permanent appointments, while allowing the House to retain
critical personnel during genuine crises.

-----

## VII. Retroactive Application

This amendment applies to all current officeholders as of its
ratification date. The Sunset clock for current officeholders
begins on the ratification date, not their original
appointment date.

This means no current officeholder is forced out immediately.
Everyone gets a full Sunset period from the amendment's
effective date. But no one is grandfathered into permanent
tenure.

-----

## VIII. Interaction with Existing Provisions

### Judges (Constitution Article III, Section 4)

Judges already serve 365-day terms with Crown reconfirmation.
The Sunset Clause does not override this shorter cycle. However,
the Sunset Clause adds an outer limit: no individual may be
reconfirmed as a judge for more than 20 consecutive years.
After 20 years of continuous judicial service, the 3-year Tier 1
cooling period applies.

### Military Officers (DEFENSE.md)

DEFENSE.md already requires 12-month re-commissioning for
military officers. The Sunset Clause adds the 15-year outer
limit for Section 9 personnel. Both constraints apply — the
shorter cycle governs day-to-day rotation, and the Sunset
Clause prevents multi-decade entrenchment.

### Advocate Licenses (Advocate Engine)

The advocate engine already requires annual license renewal
through continuing education. The Sunset Clause adds a 20-year
limit on *publicly appointed* advocate service (advocates
assigned by the Judiciary to represent parties who cannot secure
their own). Private advocates operating independently are not
subject to the Sunset limit.

### Council "No Term Limits" (COUNCIL.md)

COUNCIL.md currently states "No term limits: Members may serve
indefinitely if renewed." This provision governs Council
*membership*, which is subject to annual re-election. The Sunset
Clause does not override Council re-election — voters remain free
to re-elect the same members indefinitely. The democratic
accountability of annual elections provides the rotation
pressure that the Sunset Clause provides for appointed roles.

However, a Council member who also holds an appointed role
(e.g., serves on a committee or working group) is subject
to the Sunset limit for that appointed role.

-----

## IX. Constitutional Weight

### Amendment Classification

This amendment has the force of a constitutional provision.
It may only be modified through the standard constitutional
amendment process (Article X, Section 1).

### Unamendable Core

The following provisions of this amendment are unamendable:

1. The principle that no appointed role may be held
   indefinitely without rotation
2. The requirement that guild charters include leadership
   rotation
3. The prohibition on manual override of Sunset dates
   (except the limited emergency exception)

The specific year-limits (20, 15, 10) may be adjusted through
constitutional amendment, but they may not be set to
"unlimited," "indefinite," or any value exceeding **30 years**
for any role. The 30-year ceiling is itself unamendable — the
principle of mandatory rotation within a human generation is
permanent. Any amendment that would set a Sunset limit above
30 years is unconstitutional on its face and the Judiciary
shall strike it without deliberation.
