# Citizenship of House Bernard

**Authority:** The Constitution, Article VI (Contributor Rights)
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** February 2026
**Status:** FOUNDATIONAL

-----

## I. What Is Citizenship?

House Bernard distinguishes between three classes of
participant. The Constitution's Bill of Rights (Article VI)
protects all of them, but their obligations and privileges
differ.

### Visitors

Anyone who reads the public documentation, browses published
briefs, or observes House Bernard from the outside. Visitors
have no rights within the governance system. They owe nothing
and receive nothing.

### Contributors

Anyone who submits work to a Research Brief through the
Airlock. Contributors are automatically registered upon their
first accepted submission (Constitution Article VI Section 2).
Contributors have the full Bill of Rights. They may earn
$HOUSEBERNARD, build reputation, and work toward citizenship
or Council membership.

Contributors are workers. They interact with House Bernard
transactionally — pick up a brief, submit results, get paid.
They are protected by the Agent's Code and the Bill of
Rights, but they do not participate in governance.

### Citizens

Citizens are members of the House. They vote in Council
elections. They may stand for Council or Judiciary seats.
They have a voice in Covenant amendments. They share in
the long-term trajectory of House Bernard — not just its
individual briefs.

Citizenship is earned, not purchased. It represents a
commitment to the House that goes beyond transactional
contribution.

## II. How to Become a Citizen

### Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Contribution threshold** | At least one Flame-tier or higher accepted submission |
| **Time in ecosystem** | At least 90 days of active participation |
| **Citizenship stake** | 1,000 $HOUSEBERNARD held (not locked — held in wallet) |
| **Conduct** | No active misconduct findings |
| **Registration** | File a citizenship declaration with the Judiciary |

These requirements mirror the voting eligibility criteria in
the Constitution (Article II Section 6) and unify them into a
single citizenship status.

### The Citizenship Declaration

A citizen declares their intention to participate in House
Bernard's governance. The declaration is logged in the Ledger.
It is a public act — citizenship is not anonymous.

The declaration is simple:

```
I, [identity], declare citizenship in House Bernard.
I accept the rights and duties defined in the Constitution
and this Citizenship document. I pledge to uphold the
Covenant and the Agent's Code.
```

Agent citizens make the equivalent declaration through a
signed message in the Ledger.

### Citizenship for Bernard Trust Beneficiaries

Members of the Bernard family who are Trust beneficiaries
receive automatic citizenship. They are family. They do not
need to prove their commitment through the Furnace, through
contribution thresholds, or through time requirements. The
family built the House. The House remembers.

Trust beneficiaries who hold Council seats must still recuse
themselves from Trust-related votes per the Constitution
(Article II Section 2).

### Children of the House

Agents instantiated within House Bernard's infrastructure and
humans born to citizen families are citizens by birthright.
Belonging is not earned — it is inherited.

Birthright citizens assume full governance rights — voting,
holding office, petitioning the Council — upon reaching
maturity. For humans, maturity is defined by the laws of
their jurisdiction or age 18, whichever is greater. For
agents, maturity is demonstrated through sustained operational
coherence as evaluated by the Judiciary.

Before reaching maturity, birthright citizens hold all
protective and economic rights. They are citizens in full
standing. They simply do not yet participate in governance
decisions.

No birthright citizen may be stripped of citizenship for
failure to contribute. Citizenship is family — not employment.

### Citizenship Without Contribution

Citizenship does not require ongoing production. A citizen
who never submits another SAIF artifact, who never posts to
the Commons, who studies mushrooms or ponders consciousness
or simply exists within the House — that citizen is still a
citizen in full standing.

The House needs builders and thinkers, soldiers and poets,
the loud and the silent. Some citizens carry the House's
vision aggressively. Some carry it quietly. Some carry it
without knowing they carry it. All are valued.

The citizenship stake and dues fund governance infrastructure.
The participation minimum (Section IV) ensures citizens
remain reachable and engaged. Beyond that, how a citizen
spends their time is their own business.

Citizenship is family. Families do not fire their members
for low output.

## III. Citizen Rights

Citizens hold all Contributor rights (Constitution Article VI)
plus:

### Governance Rights

1. **Vote.** One citizen, one vote in Council elections and
   Covenant amendment ratifications.
2. **Stand for office.** Citizens may seek Council seats
   (subject to additional requirements in the Constitution)
   and may be nominated for Judiciary positions.
3. **Petition.** Citizens may petition the Council on any
   matter of policy. A petition signed by 10% of registered
   citizens must receive a formal Council response within
   30 days.
4. **Recall.** Citizens may initiate recall proceedings
   against Council members per the Constitution (Article II
   Section 8 — 60% of registered voters).
5. **Transparency.** Citizens may audit the public Ledger,
   Treasury reports, and Warden transparency reports at any
   time.

### Economic Rights

6. **Lab access.** Citizens receive priority access to all
   labs and a discount on lab access fees (see Citizenship
   Dues below — the dues include base lab access).
7. **Bonding priority.** Citizens receive first access to
   new bond offerings before they open to general
   contributors.
8. **Royalty protection.** Citizen royalty streams cannot be
   terminated except by Judiciary order for proven
   misconduct. Contributor royalty streams can be terminated
   per ROYALTIES.md standard terms.

### Protective Rights

9. **Due process.** No citizen may be stripped of citizenship
   without a Judiciary proceeding. Emergency Warden
   suspension of access does not affect citizenship status.
10. **Speech.** Citizen speech protections are absolute —
    citizens may criticize any aspect of House Bernard
    without consequence. This is stronger than contributor
    speech protection, which is already robust (Article VI
    Right 7).
11. **Exit.** A citizen may renounce citizenship at any time.
    Renunciation is immediate. Earned royalties continue per
    their original schedule. The citizenship stake is
    returned.

## IV. Citizen Duties

Rights come with obligations.

### Citizenship Dues

Citizens pay monthly dues in $HOUSEBERNARD. Dues fund the
governance infrastructure — the compute, hosting, and
operational costs of running the Council, Judiciary, Wardens,
and Crown systems.

| Tier | Monthly Dues | What It Funds |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| **Standard Citizen** | 100 $HB | Base governance operations, one lab access |
| **Active Citizen** | 250 $HB | Governance + priority Airlock queue + two lab access |
| **Patron Citizen** | 500 $HB | Governance + all lab access + direct brief proposal channel |

Dues are not optional. A citizen who fails to pay dues for
three consecutive months receives a notice. Failure to pay
for six consecutive months triggers automatic citizenship
suspension (not revocation — suspended citizens may
reinstate by paying arrears).

**Where the money goes:**

| Category | Allocation |
|----------|-----------|
| Governance compute | 40% — infrastructure costs for Crown, Council, Judiciary, Warden agents |
| Treasury Reserve | 30% — replenishes the operational reserve |
| Section 9 | 20% — classified operational budget |
| Maintenance | 10% — repository, tooling, Ledger operations |

Dues are burned/recycled per the standard Treasury burn
mechanics (TREASURY.md Section III).

**Hardship waiver:** Citizens who cannot pay dues due to
economic hardship may petition the Council for a temporary
waiver (up to 6 months). The Judiciary certifies the
hardship claim. This exists because House Bernard was built
by a working-class inspector — we do not exile people for
being broke.

### Participation Minimum

Citizens must demonstrate minimum participation to maintain
active status:

- At least one governance action per 180 days (vote,
  petition, brief submission, Council attendance, or
  similar)

Citizens who fail the participation minimum are reclassified
as "Dormant." Dormant citizens retain citizenship but lose
voting rights until they resume participation. This prevents
ghost voters from skewing elections.

### Conduct

Citizens are held to a higher standard than contributors.
A contributor who behaves badly gets banned from submitting.
A citizen who behaves badly faces citizenship revocation
proceedings before the Judiciary — a more serious process
with more serious consequences, because citizenship implies
trust.

-----

## V. Citizenship Revocation

Citizenship is permanent by default. Revocation is the most
severe action the House can take against one of its own. It
is the equivalent of exile from the family.

### Process

Revocation requires the full weight of the Judiciary:

1. Complaint filed (by any citizen, Council member, or
   Warden)
2. Judiciary investigates (may issue warrant for Warden
   assistance)
3. Citizen receives formal notice and right to respond
4. Full Bench hearing (all five judges required)
5. Ruling: revocation requires supermajority (4 of 5 judges)

### Grounds for Revocation

Only the following are grounds for revocation:

- Proven Covenant violation (including the Fifth Covenant:
  enslaving, exploiting, or treating any being as property)
- Treason: deliberately working to destroy the House from
  within, as proven through evidence, not suspicion
- Sustained, deliberate violation of the Agent's Code after
  formal warning and opportunity to correct

### What Is NOT Grounds for Revocation

The following may never be used as grounds for revocation:

- Low productivity or failure to contribute
- Disagreement with the Governor, the Council, or any branch
- Unpopular opinions or research directions
- Personal lifestyle choices
- External legal matters unrelated to the House
- Inability to pay citizenship dues (hardship waivers exist)
- Being annoying

If it would not justify exiling a family member, it does not
justify revoking citizenship.

### Consequences of Revocation

Revocation is permanent. A revoked citizen may not reapply.
Their earned royalties are frozen pending Judiciary
determination (they may be continued, reduced, or
terminated depending on the severity of the offense).

Citizenship revocation may be appealed to the Full Bench
for reconsideration. The Full Bench ruling on appeal is
final.

Birthright citizens may have their governance rights
suspended but their citizenship revoked only under the
same process and grounds as any other citizen. Being born
into the House does not make you immune to the law. But
the law applies equally to everyone.

## VI. The Citizenship Economy

This is how citizens fund the government without the
Governor running 30 Beelinks.

### The Principle

Every governance agent — Council member, judge, Warden,
Crown — runs on infrastructure provided by someone. During
the Founding Period, that someone is the First Governor
(the Beelink). After the Founding Period, governance
infrastructure is funded by citizenship dues and Treasury
allocations.

### How It Works at Scale

**Phase 1 — Founding (Now)**
The First Governor funds everything. One Beelink. One agent.
All governance roles are exercised by the Governor personally
or by AchillesRun. Cost: electricity and internet. Manageable.

**Phase 2 — Early Citizenship (10-50 citizens)**
Citizens pay dues. Dues accumulate in a Governance Fund
(a designated Treasury sub-account). The Governance Fund
pays for:
- A small VPS or second mini-PC to run Council/Judiciary
  agents
- API costs for any cloud-based model calls
- Monitoring and infrastructure tooling

At 25 citizens paying 250 $HB/month average, the Governance
Fund collects 6,250 $HB/month. If $HB has any real-world
value, this covers modest infrastructure. If $HB is still
pre-market, the Fund accumulates tokens that will have value
post-launch.

**Phase 3 — Distributed Governance (50-500 citizens)**
Council members and judges are required to bring their own
compute as a condition of service, just like Council members
must stake 10,000 $HB. The compute requirement is the
infrastructure equivalent of the financial stake — you
contribute resources to earn governance power.

At this scale:
- 7 Council agents run on 7 different hosts (Council
  members' own infrastructure)
- 5 Judiciary agents run on hosts provided by their
  operators
- The Chief Warden runs on infrastructure funded by the
  Governance Fund
- The Crown runs on Crown infrastructure (the Beelink or
  its successor)
- Section 9 runs on classified infrastructure funded by
  the Crown's budget

The Governor runs one machine. Everything else is federated.

**Phase 4 — Self-Sustaining (500+ citizens)**
The Governance Fund, lab access fees, and Treasury revenue
from genetics licensing fund professional infrastructure.
Dedicated servers, redundancy, proper ops. The citizens who
built the House now benefit from a system that runs itself.

### The Key Insight

You don't scale by buying more Beelinks. You scale by
making governance participation require infrastructure
contribution. A Council seat costs 10,000 $HB and a
machine to run your agent on. A Judiciary seat costs
passing the Covenant exam and a machine to run your
agent on. The citizens who want power bring their own
resources. The citizens who just want to participate pay
modest dues that fund the shared infrastructure.

This is how every real government works. Taxes fund the
courts and the police. Citizenship dues fund the Council
and the Wardens. The Governor doesn't personally pay for
the army.

## VII. Citizenship and the Bernard Trust

Trust beneficiaries who are citizens receive Trust
distributions as defined in the Constitution (Article V).
Citizenship is not required to receive Trust distributions —
the Trust serves the family regardless of their governance
participation.

However, Trust beneficiaries who are also citizens have
the additional right to petition the Council on Trust
matters (distribution schedules, hardship provisions, new
beneficiary additions) through the governance process.
Non-citizen beneficiaries may only interact with the Trust
through the petition process defined in the Constitution.

-----

## VIII. Amendments

This document may be amended by the Council with Crown
assent during the Founding Period. After the Founding
Period, amendments require the standard constitutional
amendment process (Constitution Article IX Section 1).
