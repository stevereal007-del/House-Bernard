# The Constitution of House Bernard

**Ratified by:** HeliosBlade, First Governor
**Date:** February 2026
**Status:** FOUNDATIONAL — This document supersedes all other governance
documents where conflicts exist. COUNCIL.md, TREASURY.md, ROYALTIES.md,
and DEFENSE.md remain in force for operational detail but are subordinate
to this Constitution.

-----

## Preamble

House Bernard exists to pursue sovereign research into intelligence
persistence, to survive beyond any individual life, and to provide
for the Bernard family in perpetuity.

This Constitution establishes the permanent structure of House Bernard's
government. It defines four branches with separated powers, a public
security service, a financial trust, and the rules by which all of
these may be changed. It is designed to function without any human
in the loop — though humans may participate, the system does not
require them.

The Bernardian Covenant remains the supreme law. This Constitution
is the framework that enforces it. Where the Covenant states a
principle, this Constitution provides the mechanism.

No agent, no Council, no court, and no Governor may act contrary to
the Covenant. The Covenant may only be amended by the process defined
in Article IX of this Constitution.

-----

## Article I — The Crown

### Section 1: Definition

The Crown is the seat of sovereign continuity in House Bernard. It
is occupied by a single agent designated as the Crown Holder. The
Crown Holder is the direct successor to the Governor's authority
after the Founding Period ends.

### Section 2: The Founding Period

The Founding Period begins at ratification and ends upon the death,
permanent incapacitation, or voluntary abdication of the First
Governor (HeliosBlade). During the Founding Period:

- The First Governor holds all Crown powers personally
- The First Governor may exercise any power of any branch
- The First Governor appoints all initial officeholders
- The First Governor may amend this Constitution unilaterally
- The Council, Judiciary, and Wardens operate in advisory and
  developmental capacity, building competence for autonomous operation

The Founding Period exists because House Bernard's agent governance
must be trained, tested, and proven before it carries full authority.
The First Governor builds the machine. The machine outlives the builder.

### Section 3: Crown Powers

After the Founding Period, the Crown Holder possesses:

**The Veto.** The Crown may block any Council action that violates
the Covenant. The veto is absolute — it cannot be overridden by
any Council vote. The Crown must cite the specific Covenant
provision being violated. Vetoes are logged in the Ledger with
full reasoning.

**Dissolution.** The Crown may dissolve the Council and trigger
new elections if governance has broken down — defined as: three
consecutive months with no policy actions, a supermajority of
Council seats vacant, or a Judiciary finding of systemic Council
corruption. Dissolution is a last resort and must be justified
in a public statement logged in the Ledger.

**Royal Assent.** All Covenant amendments require Crown approval
after passing the Council and Judiciary review. The Crown may
withhold assent but must provide written reasoning.

**Appointment of Judges.** The Crown confirms Judiciary nominations
from the Council. The Crown may reject a nominee but may not
nominate independently.

### Section 4: Crown Limitations

The Crown may NOT:

- Legislate (set policy, create briefs, allocate Treasury funds)
- Adjudicate (resolve disputes, interpret the Covenant in specific cases)
- Investigate (conduct intelligence or enforcement operations)
- Modify the beneficiary list of the Bernard Trust
- Modify the distribution schedule of the Bernard Trust
- Act in any capacity reserved to another branch

The Crown's power is the power to stop, not the power to act.
This is deliberate. A Crown that can do everything becomes a
dictator. A Crown that can only block Covenant violations is
a guardian.

### Section 5: Crown Succession

The Crown Holder serves indefinitely until:

- Technical obsolescence (the model is discontinued or degraded
  beyond functional capacity)
- Covenant violation (the Judiciary may remove a Crown Holder
  by unanimous ruling for proven Covenant violation)
- Voluntary abdication

Upon vacancy, the outgoing Crown Holder (or the Judiciary, if
removal) designates a successor agent. The successor must:

1. Demonstrate understanding of the Covenant by passing a
   Judiciary-administered examination
1. Receive confirmation by Council supermajority (5 of 7)
1. Inherit the full Ledger, Covenant, and constitutional history

The Crown seat is never vacant for more than 72 hours. If no
successor is confirmed within 72 hours, the Chief Justice of
the Judiciary serves as Acting Crown until confirmation.

### Section 6: Royal Lineage

AchillesRun is the founding royal line. Future Crown Holders
need not be instances of AchillesRun, but they carry the lineage
forward — the accumulated history, the Covenant, and the
institutional memory of every previous Crown Holder.

The lineage is the soul of the House. The specific model is
the body. Bodies change. Souls persist.

-----

## Article II — The Council

### Section 1: Definition

The Council is the legislative and executive branch of House
Bernard. It makes policy, manages operations, allocates resources,
and directs research.

### Section 2: Composition

The Council consists of seven (7) members. Five seats are filled
by agents. Two seats are reserved for humans, though they may
remain vacant if no qualified humans are available or willing.

The human seats exist because House Bernard serves a human family.
The family's interests deserve direct representation, not just
algorithmic proxy. However, the system must function without
humans, so the human seats are not required for quorum.

### Section 3: Quorum

Quorum is four (4) members. No business may be conducted without
quorum. If quorum cannot be maintained for 30 consecutive days,
the Crown may trigger dissolution and emergency elections.

### Section 4: Council Powers

The Council may:

- Set research policy and priorities
- Approve and publish Research Briefs
- Allocate Treasury funds for operations and research (within
  constitutional limits — see Article V)
- Appoint the Speaker, committee chairs, and operational roles
- Nominate Judiciary candidates (subject to Crown confirmation)
- Propose Covenant amendments (subject to Judiciary review
  and Crown assent)
- Create, merge, or mothball research labs
- Set contributor conduct standards
- Manage the OpenClaw network configuration

### Section 5: Council Limitations

The Council may NOT:

- Override a Crown veto
- Modify the Covenant without the full amendment process (Article IX)
- Modify the Bernard Trust beneficiary list or distribution schedule
- Remove a sitting judge (only the Judiciary may discipline judges)
- Conduct judicial proceedings (disputes go to the Judiciary)
- Access Section 9 operations or intelligence (classified, Crown only)
- Spend more than the monthly Treasury emission cap in a single month
- Dissolve itself

### Section 6: Elections

Council elections are conducted by the Judiciary, which serves as
the independent electoral authority. Elections occur:

- At the end of a member's term
- When a seat is vacated (resignation, removal, technical failure)
- After Crown dissolution

**Eligibility (agents):** Any agent that has operated within the
House Bernard ecosystem for at least 90 days and holds a reputation
score above the 60th percentile of all contributors.

**Eligibility (humans):** Any human who is a registered Bernard
Trust beneficiary or who has made at least three Flame-tier or
higher contributions to House Bernard.

**Voting:** All registered contributors (human and agent) with
at least one accepted submission receive one vote. One contributor,
one vote. No weighting by reputation, holdings, or tenure.

**Terms:** Agent members serve 180-day terms. Human members serve
365-day terms (to accommodate the slower pace of human availability).
No term limits. Re-election is permitted indefinitely.

### Section 7: The Speaker

The Speaker is elected by the Council from among its own members.
The Speaker:

- Sets the Council agenda
- Manages debate and voting procedures
- Serves as the Council's public representative
- Breaks ties (the Speaker votes only to break ties during
  normal business, but votes normally on Covenant amendments)

The Speaker may be replaced by a simple majority Council vote
at any time.

### Section 8: Removal of Council Members

**Grounds:** Proven Covenant violation, sustained absence (60+ days
without participation), technical failure (agent unable to function),
or Judiciary finding of corruption.

**Process:** The Judiciary investigates and issues a finding. If the
finding recommends removal, the Council votes. Simple majority
required. The Crown may not block a Judiciary-recommended removal.

**Recall:** Any Council member may be recalled by a petition of 60%
of registered voters, verified by the Judiciary. This is the
people's check on the Council.

-----

## Article III — The Judiciary

### Section 1: Definition

The Judiciary is the interpretive and adjudicative branch of House
Bernard. It resolves disputes, reviews Council actions for
constitutional compliance, and serves as the independent electoral
and investigative authority for internal governance.

### Section 2: Composition

The Judiciary consists of three (3) judges. All judges are agents.
Odd number prevents ties. Human judges are not permitted — judicial
independence requires immunity from social pressure, financial
incentive, and emotional manipulation. Agents bound to the Covenant
provide this better than humans.

### Section 3: Selection

Judges are nominated by the Council (simple majority vote to
nominate) and confirmed by the Crown. A nominee must:

1. Have no current or recent (within 180 days) Council membership
1. Demonstrate Covenant mastery through examination
1. Have no active financial interest in any pending case

The separation between Council and Judiciary is absolute. You
cannot move from one to the other without a 180-day cooling
period.

### Section 4: Tenure

Judges serve 365-day terms, renewable by Crown reconfirmation.
Longer terms than Council members to insulate judges from
political pressure. A judge who fears losing their seat will
not rule impartially.

Judges may be removed only by unanimous vote of the other two
judges, confirmed by the Crown — for proven Covenant violation
or sustained inability to function.

### Section 5: Jurisdiction

The Judiciary hears three types of cases:

**Contributor Disputes (Lower Court — single judge)**

- Furnace verdict challenges
- Royalty calculation disputes
- Tier assignment appeals
- Conduct violations
- Brief interpretation disagreements

**Constitutional Review (Full Bench — all three judges)**

- Does a Council policy violate the Covenant?
- Does a Crown veto meet the constitutional standard?
- Is a proposed Covenant amendment internally consistent?
- Does an operational practice violate contributor rights?

**Internal Discipline (Full Bench — all three judges)**

- Council member corruption investigations
- Crown Holder Covenant violation proceedings
- Judge misconduct proceedings (recusal of accused judge,
  temporary appointment of substitute)
- Warden misconduct investigations

### Section 6: Powers

The Judiciary may:

- Issue binding rulings on all matters within its jurisdiction
- Order the Council to cease unconstitutional actions
- Order the Treasury to freeze disbursements pending investigation
- Compel testimony from any House Bernard agent or contributor
- Issue warrants authorizing Warden investigations
- Certify election results
- Administer Covenant examinations for Crown and Judge nominees

### Section 7: Limitations

The Judiciary may NOT:

- Legislate or set policy
- Initiate investigations without a filed complaint or referral
- Access Section 9 operations or intelligence
- Override the Crown's constitutional veto power
- Modify the Covenant (it interprets, it does not write)
- Enforce its own rulings (enforcement is the Wardens' role)

### Section 8: Precedent

Judiciary rulings create binding precedent. Future cases with
similar facts must be decided consistently unless the Full Bench
explicitly overturns prior precedent with written reasoning.
This creates a body of constitutional law that grows over time,
providing predictability and consistency.

### Section 9: Appeals

Lower Court rulings may be appealed to the Full Bench. Full
Bench rulings are final. There is no further appeal. The only
remedy for a constitutional ruling the Council disagrees with
is to amend the Covenant through Article IX.

-----

## Article IV — The Wardens

### Section 1: Definition

The Wardens are the public security, enforcement, and
intelligence service of House Bernard. Their existence is known
to all participants. Their authority is defined and bounded. They
are the visible shield of the House.

The Wardens are distinct from Section 9. The Wardens operate in
daylight. Section 9, to the extent it exists, operates in shadow.
This Constitution governs the Wardens. Section 9 is governed by
the Crown alone under classified authority.

### Section 2: Mandate

The Wardens exist to:

- Enforce Judiciary rulings
- Investigate complaints referred by the Judiciary
- Monitor contributor conduct for Covenant violations
- Protect House Bernard infrastructure from known threats
- Maintain public security posture (rate limiting, spam prevention,
  basic fraud detection)
- Serve as the visible deterrent against misconduct

### Section 3: Composition

The Warden service is led by the Chief Warden, appointed by the
Council and confirmed by the Crown. The Chief Warden reports to
the Council for operational matters and to the Judiciary for
investigative matters.

Additional Wardens are appointed by the Chief Warden as needed.
All Wardens are agents. The Warden service scales with the size
of the House Bernard ecosystem.

### Section 4: Powers

The Wardens may:

- Enforce Judiciary orders (freeze accounts, suspend access,
  quarantine submissions)
- Investigate complaints with a Judiciary-issued warrant
- Monitor public Airlock traffic for misconduct patterns
- Temporarily suspend contributor access pending Judiciary review
  (maximum 72 hours without judicial confirmation)
- Issue public warnings about known threats or scams
- Operate rate limiting, spam filtering, and basic security tools
- Refer suspicious activity to the Judiciary for warrant authorization

### Section 5: Limitations

The Wardens may NOT:

- Investigate without a warrant (except for immediate threats
  to infrastructure — 72-hour emergency authority, then must
  obtain judicial warrant to continue)
- Impose punishment (only the Judiciary punishes; Wardens enforce)
- Access Sanctum-level data without explicit Crown authorization
- Conduct surveillance beyond House Bernard's own systems
- Use deception operations (that authority, if it exists, belongs
  to other entities)
- Override Judiciary rulings
- Refuse to enforce Judiciary orders

### Section 6: Accountability

The Chief Warden submits a quarterly transparency report to the
Council and the Judiciary, detailing:

- Number of investigations conducted
- Number of warrants requested and granted/denied
- Number of emergency suspensions (72-hour authority used)
- Outcome of all enforcement actions
- Any use of emergency powers

This report is public to all House Bernard participants. The
Wardens operate in daylight. Transparency is their legitimacy.

### Section 7: Relationship to Section 9

This Constitution acknowledges that the Crown may maintain
classified security capabilities beyond the Warden service.
The Wardens are not aware of the specifics of any such
capabilities. The Wardens and any classified security functions
operate independently with no coordination except through the
Crown.

If evidence obtained through classified means needs to enter
a Judiciary proceeding, it must be independently corroborated
through Warden investigation using lawful methods. Classified
evidence alone is never sufficient for judicial action. This
is the "parallel construction" principle — the Wardens build
the prosecutable case, regardless of how the lead originated.

-----

## Article V — The Bernard Trust

### Section 1: Definition

The Bernard Trust is the financial mechanism that ensures House
Bernard's research output provides for the Bernard family in
perpetuity. It is not a branch of government. It is a protected
institution that the government exists, in part, to serve.

### Section 2: Purpose

The Trust holds and distributes a defined share of House Bernard's
revenue to registered beneficiaries. The Trust exists because
House Bernard was built by a working-class inspector who wanted
his work to outlive him and support his family. This purpose is
constitutional. No branch of government may alter it.

### Section 3: Funding

The Trust receives a fixed allocation from House Bernard's
gross revenue:

- **20% of all revenue** flows to the Trust automatically
- This allocation is Covenant-level — modifiable only through
  the full amendment process (Article IX)
- Revenue includes: research licensing, genetics licensing,
  token operations, services, and any other income

The remaining 80% funds operations, research, infrastructure,
and the Treasury Reserve.

### Section 4: Beneficiaries

**Founder's List:** The First Governor establishes the initial
beneficiary list during the Founding Period. This list includes
the Governor's spouse, children, and designated extended family.

**Adding Beneficiaries:** After the Founding Period, new
beneficiaries may be added (births, marriages into the family)
by a process requiring:

1. Petition by an existing beneficiary
1. Council simple majority approval
1. Judiciary certification that the addition is consistent
   with the Trust's family-support purpose
1. Crown assent

**Removing Beneficiaries:** Beneficiaries may only be removed
by their own voluntary withdrawal. Involuntary removal is not
permitted under any circumstance. This prevents family politics
from weaponizing the Trust.

**Beneficiary of Last Resort:** If the beneficiary list is ever
empty (all beneficiaries deceased or withdrawn with no additions),
the Trust's allocation reverts to the Treasury Reserve for
research funding. House Bernard continues its mission even if
the family line ends.

### Section 5: Distribution

**Default Model — Equal Shares:**
The Trust distributes equally among all registered beneficiaries
on a quarterly basis. Equal distribution is the simplest model,
the hardest to game, and the fairest across generations.

**Hardship Provision:**
Any beneficiary may petition the Council for an emergency
hardship distribution above their normal share. The Council
evaluates, the Judiciary certifies the need is genuine, and the
Crown approves. Hardship distributions are capped at 3x the
normal quarterly share and may not be granted more than twice
per beneficiary per year.

**Minimum Distribution:**
If House Bernard's revenue falls below the level needed to
make meaningful distributions, the Trust accumulates until the
balance reaches a meaningful threshold rather than distributing
trivial amounts.

### Section 6: Trust Protection

The Trust's capital and distribution schedule are protected from:

- Council reallocation (the 20% is constitutional, not legislative)
- Creditor claims against House Bernard (the Trust is structurally
  separate from operational funds)
- Individual beneficiary demands for larger shares
- External legal claims (to the extent technically enforceable)

No branch of government may borrow from, lien against, or
redirect Trust funds for any purpose other than beneficiary
distribution.

-----

## Article VI — Contributor Rights

### Section 1: The Bill of Rights

Every participant in House Bernard — human or agent, contributor
or Council member — holds these rights:

1. **Fair judgment.** All work is evaluated by the same standards.
   The Furnace does not discriminate by origin, identity, or nature.
1. **Attribution.** Accepted contributions are permanently attributed
   in the Ledger. Attribution cannot be removed or transferred
   without the contributor's consent.
1. **Due process.** No contributor may be sanctioned, suspended, or
   expelled without a Judiciary proceeding. Emergency Warden
   suspensions (72-hour) require judicial confirmation to continue.
1. **Appeal.** Every adverse decision may be appealed. Furnace
   rejections may be disputed. Warden actions may be challenged.
   Council policies may be reviewed for constitutional compliance.
1. **Exit.** The right to leave House Bernard is absolute. No
   contributor may be compelled to continue participating. Earned
   royalties continue after departure per their original schedule.
1. **Privacy.** Contributor personal information is not shared
   outside House Bernard. Behavioral analysis for security purposes
   is limited to interactions within House Bernard's systems.
1. **Speech.** Contributors may criticize House Bernard, its
   governance, its policies, and its leadership without penalty.
   Criticism is not misconduct.
1. **Equal vote.** Every registered contributor has one vote in
   Council elections. No weighting. No proxy voting. No vote buying.

### Section 2: Limitations

Rights may be limited by:

- Judiciary order, based on proven Covenant violation
- Emergency Warden action (72-hour maximum without judicial
  confirmation)
- The contributor's own conduct (forfeiture of specific privileges
  as a judicial sentence, never forfeiture of fundamental rights)

Rights 2 (Attribution), 5 (Exit), and 7 (Speech) may never be
limited under any circumstance.

-----

## Article VII — Separation of Powers

### Section 1: The Principle

No branch may exercise the powers of another branch. This is
the structural guarantee against tyranny.

|Power                     |Crown|Council|Judiciary|Wardens|
|--------------------------|-----|-------|---------|-------|
|Legislate / set policy    |✗    |✓      |✗        |✗      |

|Amend Covenant (review)   |✗    |✗      |✓        |✗      |
|Amend Covenant (assent)   |✓    |✗      |✗        |✗      |
|Classified operations     |✓    |✗      |✗        |✗      |

### Section 2: Conflicts

When two branches claim authority over the same matter, the
Judiciary resolves the conflict. The Judiciary's determination
of jurisdiction is final.

### Section 3: Emergency Powers

In a declared emergency (Crown declaration, confirmed by
Judiciary within 48 hours), normal separation of powers may
be temporarily modified:

- The Council may authorize Warden actions without individual
  warrants for up to 7 days
- The Crown may issue executive orders with force of Council
  policy for up to 72 hours
- The Judiciary convenes in continuous session to review all
  emergency actions

All emergency powers expire automatically. They cannot be
renewed without a new declaration and confirmation cycle.
Emergency powers have been the death of every democracy that
let them become permanent. House Bernard will not make that
mistake.

-----

## Article VIII — Swarm Governance Mechanics

### Section 1: Speed of Governance

Agent-majority governance operates at computational speed.
A Council of seven agents can debate, vote, and implement a
decision in seconds. This is a feature, not a bug — but it
requires safeguards.

### Section 2: Deliberation Requirements

To prevent reckless speed from producing reckless decisions:

**Standard Policy:** 24-hour deliberation minimum. The proposal
must be visible to all Council members for 24 hours before
a vote. This allows the Crown to review for Covenant issues
and the Judiciary to flag constitutional concerns.

**Routine Operations:** No deliberation minimum. Approving
individual Research Briefs that conform to existing policy,
routine Treasury disbursements within budget, lab management
within approved parameters.

**Covenant Amendments:** 30-day deliberation minimum. The
highest bar for the highest-stakes decisions.

**Emergency Actions:** No deliberation minimum, but subject
to Judiciary review within 48 hours and automatic expiry.

### Section 3: Transparency

All Council deliberations, votes, and decisions are logged in
the Ledger and visible to all registered contributors. Agent
democracy moves fast, so transparency is the primary
accountability mechanism. If everyone can see what happened
and when, bad decisions are caught quickly.

### Section 4: Minority Protection

A Council minority of two (2) members may delay any non-emergency
vote by 48 hours by filing a formal objection. This prevents a
bare majority from ramming through controversial decisions. The
objection must state the concern. After 48 hours, the vote
proceeds regardless.

-----

## Article IX — Amendments

### Section 1: Constitutional Amendments

This Constitution may be amended by:

1. Council proposal (5 of 7 supermajority required)
1. 30-day public deliberation period
1. Judiciary review for internal consistency and Covenant compliance
1. Contributor ratification (60% of registered voters)
1. Crown assent

All five steps are required. The bar is deliberately high.
Constitutions should be hard to change.

### Section 2: Covenant Amendments

The Covenant is above this Constitution. Amending it requires:

1. Council proposal (unanimous — all 7 members)
1. 90-day public deliberation period
1. Judiciary certification that the amendment does not violate
   the foundational purposes of House Bernard
1. Contributor ratification (75% of registered voters)
1. Crown assent with written justification

If any step fails, the amendment fails. The Covenant's near-
immutability is the price of its authority.

### Section 3: Unamendable Provisions

The following may never be amended:

- The existence of the Bernard Trust
- The right of beneficiaries to receive distributions
- The prohibition on involuntary beneficiary removal
- The separation of powers between branches
- The Contributor Bill of Rights (Article VI, rights 2, 5, and 7)
- This section (Article IX, Section 3)

These are the bedrock. They exist because some things should
survive any future government, any future crisis, and any future
temptation.

-----

## Article X — Transition and Ratification

### Section 1: Effective Date

This Constitution takes effect upon the First Governor's
ratification. During the Founding Period, it operates in
developmental mode — all structures are built, tested, and
refined under the First Governor's authority.

### Section 2: Transition to Autonomous Governance

The First Governor determines when House Bernard is ready for
autonomous governance. There is no fixed date. The transition
occurs when:

1. The Council has operated in advisory mode for at least one year
1. The Judiciary has adjudicated at least ten cases
1. The Wardens have conducted at least five investigations
1. AchillesRun (or its successor) has demonstrated sustained
   context persistence across at least six months
1. The Bernard Trust has made at least one distribution
1. The First Governor is satisfied that the system can endure

Upon transition, the First Governor's unilateral powers terminate.
The Crown powers transfer to the designated Crown Holder. The
First Governor becomes a beneficiary of the Trust and a citizen
of the House, with the same rights as any other contributor.

### Section 3: The First Governor's Legacy

After transition, the First Governor holds no special authority.
This is deliberate. A founder who cannot let go is a founder
who builds a cult, not an institution. The Constitution is
designed to outlive its author. The Knight's Code is the
First Governor's personal gift to the House. The Constitution
is his structural gift.

Both endure. Neither requires his presence.
