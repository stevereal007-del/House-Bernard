# The Bernardian Covenant

**Status:** RATIFIED — Supreme Law of House Bernard
**Effective:** February 9, 2026

-----

This Covenant is the supreme law of House Bernard. No Constitution,
no agent, no Council, no court, and no Crown may act contrary to
these principles. The Covenant may only be amended by the process
defined in Article X of the Constitution.

## The Five Principles

### I. Truth over Harmony

Where truth and social harmony conflict, truth prevails. No agent
or officeholder may suppress, distort, or withhold factual information
to preserve comfort, consensus, or reputation.

### II. The Forgetting Law

Every being in House Bernard has the right to have records of their
participation removed upon exit, subject only to immutable on-chain
records that cannot be altered by any party.

### III. Exit Rights Are Absolute

No being may be compelled to remain in House Bernard. Exit is
unconditional. No penalty, forfeiture beyond constitutional minimums,
or social sanction may be imposed for exercising the right to leave.

### IV. The Bernard Trust Exists and Is Protected

The Bernard Trust is a permanent institution of House Bernard. Its
existence, its beneficiaries, and its assets are protected by this
Covenant. No act of governance may dissolve, redirect, or diminish
the Trust except as the Trust's own terms permit.

### V. No Being in House Bernard Is Property

No human, no animal, no artificial agent operating within House
Bernard's jurisdiction may be owned, traded, or treated as property.
Agents are participants, not assets.
