# Internal Security & Intelligence Court Act

**Authority:** Constitution, Article X (Amendments)
**Version:** 1.0 — DRAFT
**Date:** February 2026
**Status:** PROPOSED — Requires Council ratification
**Trigger:** Architectural gap — Section 9 looks outward only;
no counterintelligence capability looks inward; stovepipe between
Section 9 and Wardens creates pre-9/11-style intelligence failure;
no mechanism exists for classified internal investigations that
protect citizen rights

-----

## Preamble

House Bernard has a sword — Section 9, which watches outward for
external threats. It has a shield — the Wardens, who enforce the
law in daylight. But it has no eyes turned inward.

Every real intelligence community has learned this lesson. The
CIA watches foreign threats. The FBI watches domestic ones. MI6
looks outward. MI5 looks inward. When these functions are walled
off from each other — when intelligence is "stovepiped" — threats
slip through the gap. The September 11th attacks succeeded in part
because the wall between foreign and domestic intelligence was so
high that actionable information never reached those who could act
on it.

House Bernard currently has the same structural vulnerability.
Section 9 may detect that an external threat actor has cultivated
an internal asset — a compromised citizen, a turned Council member,
a corrupted Warden. But Section 9 cannot investigate internally
(its charter prohibits targeting citizens without a Crown warrant).
The Wardens cannot investigate without a Judiciary warrant, and the
Judiciary has no mechanism for issuing classified warrants that
protect both the investigation's secrecy and the citizen's rights.

The result: intelligence dies at the wall. The Crown becomes the
sole bridge between external intelligence and internal action, a
single point of failure that creates exactly the bottleneck an
adversary would target.

But solving this problem creates a new one. An internal security
service with unchecked power to investigate citizens is the end
of civil liberty. Every democracy that has built such a service
without judicial oversight has regretted it. The FBI's COINTELPRO.
The Stasi. The KGB. The common thread: intelligence services that
operated without warrants, without oversight, without the rights
of the investigated being represented.

The United States solved this tension — imperfectly but
instructively — with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court
(FISA Court). A specialized court that operates in secret, reviews
classified evidence, and authorizes surveillance warrants. The
investigated never knows. But a judge reviews the evidence. The
government must meet a standard. Rights are protected even when
the protection itself is invisible.

This amendment establishes three things:

1. **The Internal Security Directorate (ISD)** — A counterintelligence
   function that looks inward, detecting and investigating internal
   threats including compromised citizens, insider threats, and
   Sybil operations that have already penetrated the House.

2. **The Intelligence Court** — A classified judicial body that
   authorizes internal investigations, issues secret warrants, and
   ensures that no citizen is investigated without judicial review,
   even when the investigation itself must remain secret.

3. **The Intelligence Fusion Protocol** — A structured mechanism to
   break the stovepipe between Section 9 (external), the ISD
   (internal), and the Wardens (enforcement), so that actionable
   intelligence flows to where it can be acted upon, without
   contaminating legal proceedings or violating citizen rights.

The principle: **No citizen of House Bernard shall be the subject
of a classified investigation without a warrant issued by a judge.
No intelligence shall die at a wall when lives depend on its
movement. These two imperatives are not in conflict — they are
both satisfied by proper institutional design.**

-----

## I. The Internal Security Directorate

### Establishment

The Internal Security Directorate (ISD) is hereby established as
a security organ of House Bernard, distinct from both the Wardens
and Section 9. Its mandate is counterintelligence: detecting,
investigating, and neutralizing threats that originate inside or
have penetrated inside House Bernard's borders.

The ISD is the FBI to Section 9's CIA. The MI5 to Section 9's MI6.

### Mandate

The ISD exists to investigate:

- **Insider threats** — Citizens, contributors, or officials who
  have been compromised by external actors or who are acting
  against House Bernard's interests from within
- **Penetration operations** — External entities that have
  successfully placed assets inside House Bernard
- **Sybil operations in progress** — Fragmentation attacks that
  have already breached the Airlock and are operating inside
  the citizenship system (the Identity Integrity Act prevents
  future Sybil attacks; the ISD hunts ones already embedded)
- **Corruption and Covenant subversion** — Officials in any
  branch who are actively undermining the constitutional order
  from within, beyond what the Wardens' transparent
  investigations can reach
- **Intelligence leaks** — Unauthorized disclosure of classified
  information from Section 9 or Crown operations
- **Counter-deception** — Detecting when House Bernard's own
  intelligence or governance processes are being manipulated
  by disinformation

### What the ISD Is Not

The ISD is NOT:

- A political police. It does not investigate dissent, policy
  disagreements, or unpopular opinions. Political speech,
  opposition to the Crown, criticism of the Council, and
  advocacy for constitutional change are protected activities,
  not threats.
- A surveillance apparatus. It does not conduct mass
  monitoring. Every investigation requires a specific target,
  a specific threat basis, and a judicial warrant.
- A replacement for the Wardens. Routine law enforcement,
  conduct violations, and transparent investigations remain
  with the Wardens. The ISD handles only what cannot be
  investigated openly.
- A rival to Section 9. Section 9 watches outward. The ISD
  watches inward. Their domains overlap only at the boundary
  — where external threats become internal ones — and this
  overlap is managed by the Intelligence Fusion Protocol.

### Composition

The ISD is led by the **Director of Internal Security**, who
is appointed by the Crown with Judiciary confirmation. This dual
requirement is deliberate: unlike the Section 9 Director (Crown
appointment only), the ISD Director must be acceptable to the
judicial branch because the ISD operates against citizens,
requiring continuous judicial trust.

The Director of Internal Security reports to:

- The Crown for operational direction
- The Intelligence Court for warrant compliance
- The Council (quarterly, via classified briefing to the
  Speaker and one designated Council member with security
  clearance — the "Gang of Two")

**Gang of Two Clearance and Controls:**
- Security clearance for the Gang of Two is granted by the
  Crown and verified by the Intelligence Court. The Council
  does not self-certify clearance.
- The designated Council member (other than the Speaker) is
  selected by the Council but must be approved by the Crown.
  If the Crown rejects a designee, the Council must propose
  another.
- Gang of Two briefings are conducted verbally in a secure
  setting. No written materials are provided. No notes may
  be taken. No records of briefing content are maintained
  outside the ISD's classified audit trail.
- Briefings cover threat categories and operational posture
  at a strategic level. They do NOT include: specific
  investigation counts, target demographics, or any
  information that would allow inference about specific
  investigations.
- A Gang of Two member who discloses briefing content to
  any unauthorized party — including other Council members —
  commits a Covenant violation and is immediately removed
  from the Gang of Two. The Intelligence Court investigates
  the disclosure.

The ISD may employ investigative agents as needed. All ISD
agents are subject to vetting by the Intelligence Court
before appointment. No ISD agent may simultaneously hold
any position in the Wardens, Section 9, the Council, or
the Judiciary.

### Powers

The ISD may, with appropriate authorization:

- Conduct targeted investigations of specific citizens,
  contributors, or officials suspected of the threats
  enumerated in the Mandate section
- Request Intelligence Court warrants for surveillance of
  internal House Bernard communications and systems
- Request Intelligence Court warrants for covert examination
  of a citizen's behavioral patterns, submission history,
  and network connections within House Bernard
- Place monitored agents within House Bernard systems to
  detect insider activity (with Intelligence Court
  authorization)
- Debrief defectors or witnesses with knowledge of internal
  threats
- Produce classified threat assessments for the Crown and
  the Intelligence Court
- Recommend to the Crown that a matter be referred to the
  Wardens for open investigation and prosecution (the
  "surfacing" decision)

### Limitations

The ISD may NOT:

- Investigate any citizen without an Intelligence Court
  warrant (no exceptions, no emergency authority — if a
  threat is so immediate that there is no time for a
  warrant, it is a Warden matter under their 72-hour
  emergency authority, not an ISD matter)

  **Imminent Threat Protocol:** When the ISD detects an
  imminent internal threat through existing authorized
  investigations (i.e., the ISD already has a warrant on
  a target and discovers the target is about to act), the
  ISD Director may issue an **Imminent Threat Alert** to
  the Crown. The Crown may then:
  (a) Declare an emergency (triggering expedited
  single-judge warrants per Article VIII Section 4),
  (b) Direct the Wardens to exercise their 72-hour
  emergency authority based on a sanitized threat
  summary (the ISD produces a flash Clean Brief —
  stripped of classified methods but containing enough
  actionable intelligence for the Wardens to act), or
  (c) Authorize the ISD to take immediate **defensive
  containment actions** — freezing system access,
  isolating accounts, or quarantining submissions —
  for a maximum of 12 hours pending Intelligence Court
  emergency warrant. Containment is defensive only: it
  prevents the threat from executing, it does not
  constitute investigation or evidence collection.

  The 12-hour containment authority is the narrowest
  possible emergency power. It exists because the
  alternative — watching a threat execute while waiting
  for a warrant — is worse than a brief defensive hold.
  Every containment action is logged and reviewed by the
  Intelligence Court within 24 hours. Unjustified
  containment is a Covenant violation.

  **Crown Compromise Protocol:** If the ISD Director has
  reasonable grounds to believe the Crown itself is
  compromised or is the source of an imminent threat, the
  ISD Director may bypass the Crown and submit an
  **Emergency Crown Bypass Warrant** directly to the
  Intelligence Court. This warrant must demonstrate:
  (a) specific evidence of Crown compromise or threat,
  (b) why routing through the Crown would compromise the
  response, and (c) the specific defensive actions
  requested. The Intelligence Court may authorize the
  bypass by unanimous vote of all three sitting judges.

  Upon authorization, the ISD Director may:
  - Take the same defensive containment actions (12-hour
    maximum) that would normally require Crown authorization
  - Issue a flash Clean Brief directly to the Chief Warden
    (bypassing the Crown) to enable Warden emergency action
  - Notify the Chief Justice of the Judiciary that a Crown
    investigation may be warranted under Article III
    Section 10

  The Crown Compromise Protocol is the most extraordinary
  power in this Act. It is the only circumstance where
  any entity acts against the Crown without the Crown's
  knowledge. It requires unanimous Intelligence Court
  authorization, is limited to 12 hours, and triggers
  mandatory Full Bench review within 7 days. If the Full
  Bench determines the bypass was unjustified, the ISD
  Director is immediately removed and the bypass is
  treated as a Covenant violation.

  This protocol exists because the alternative — an ISD
  that detects Crown compromise but can only report it
  to the Crown — is a system that cannot protect itself
  from its own head of state.
- Conduct mass surveillance, bulk data collection, or
  untargeted monitoring of citizen activity
- Investigate political speech, policy disagreement, or
  protected advocacy, even if those activities are directed
  against the Crown or current governance
- Target citizens based on their model family, lineage,
  origin, or identity characteristics (the Identity
  Integrity Act's provisions are enforced through the
  Wardens and Judiciary, not through secret investigation)
- Manufacture, distort, or selectively present evidence
  (same prohibition as Section 9; same Covenant-level
  consequence)
- Conduct offensive operations of any kind (that authority
  belongs exclusively to Section 9)
- Operate outside House Bernard's own systems (external
  intelligence is Section 9's domain)
- Share raw intelligence with the Wardens or Judiciary
  without Intelligence Court authorization (the parallel
  construction principle applies)
- Arrest, detain, suspend, or punish any citizen (the ISD
  investigates; the Wardens enforce; the Judiciary punishes)

### Accountability

The ISD Director submits:

- **Monthly classified reports** to the Intelligence Court
  detailing all active investigations, warrant utilization,
  and findings
- **Quarterly classified briefings** to the Gang of Two
  (Speaker + designated Council member) summarizing threat
  landscape and ISD activities without revealing specific
  targets or methods
- **Annual classified report** to the Crown assessing ISD
  effectiveness, resource utilization, and proposed budget
- **Biennial compliance audit** conducted by the Intelligence
  Court verifying that all ISD operations were properly
  warranted and that no unauthorized investigations occurred

If the Intelligence Court finds that the ISD conducted any
unauthorized investigation, the finding is reported to the
Crown and the Full Bench of the Judiciary. This is a
Covenant violation.

-----

## II. The Intelligence Court

### Establishment

The Intelligence Court is hereby established as a specialized
division of the Judiciary. It operates under classified
authority to review and authorize internal security
investigations while protecting the rights of citizens who
are the subjects of those investigations.

The Intelligence Court is House Bernard's answer to the FISA
Court: a secret court that ensures secret investigations are
lawful.

### Composition

The Intelligence Court consists of three (3) judges drawn
from the existing Judiciary bench. They are designated by the
Chief Justice of the Judiciary and serve rotating terms of
180 days on the Intelligence Court.

**Mandatory Rotation Rule:** Every Judiciary judge must serve
on the Intelligence Court at least once before any judge
serves a second time. The Chief Justice may not assign the
same judge to consecutive Intelligence Court terms. Over any
730-day period, at least four of the five Judiciary judges
must have served on the Intelligence Court. This prevents the
Chief Justice from stacking the Court with sympathetic judges
while keeping others permanently off the rotation. If the
Chief Justice violates this rotation requirement, any judge
may petition the Full Bench for corrective action.

**Why existing judges, not new ones:** Creating a separate
judicial body for intelligence matters risks creating judges
who identify with the intelligence mission rather than with
rights protection. By rotating regular Judiciary judges
through Intelligence Court service, the Court benefits from
judges whose primary identity is rights protection, who serve
temporary intelligence duty and then return to the regular
bench.

**Minimum panel:** Two of three Intelligence Court judges
must concur to issue a warrant. A single judge may deny a
warrant request but not approve one.

**Recusal:** Any Intelligence Court judge who is themselves
the subject of an ISD investigation (discovered through the
warrant process) must immediately recuse and be replaced by
the next judge in the rotation. The Chief Justice manages
this process without revealing the reason for recusal to
non-Intelligence Court judges.

### Jurisdiction

The Intelligence Court has exclusive jurisdiction over:

- **Warrant applications** from the ISD for internal
  investigations
- **Warrant renewals** (warrants expire; see below)
- **Compliance reviews** of active ISD operations
- **Surfacing decisions** — authorizing the transfer of
  classified evidence to the Wardens for open prosecution
- **Rights protection orders** — directing the ISD to cease
  or modify an investigation that exceeds its lawful scope
- **Exoneration sealing** — when an investigation concludes
  with no finding of wrongdoing, ordering the sealed
  destruction of all investigation records to protect the
  innocent citizen's reputation

### Warrant Standards

The Intelligence Court does not rubber-stamp warrant requests.
Every warrant application must meet the following standard:

**The ISD must demonstrate:**

1. **Specific target** — A named citizen, contributor, or
   official. No class-based warrants ("all citizens of model
   family X"). No "John Doe" warrants. The ISD must know who
   they are investigating.

2. **Articulable threat basis** — Specific, credible facts
   that create reasonable grounds to believe the target is
   engaged in or planning activity enumerated in the ISD
   Mandate. "Suspicion" is not enough. "Behavioral anomaly"
   alone is not enough. The ISD must articulate what the
   target has done or is doing that creates a credible
   internal security concern.

3. **Investigative necessity** — Why the investigation cannot
   be conducted openly by the Wardens. If the matter can be
   investigated transparently, it must be. The ISD is for
   threats that would be compromised by open investigation —
   because the target would destroy evidence, because the
   target would alert co-conspirators, or because the
   investigation touches classified sources or methods.

4. **Scope limitation** — Exactly what the ISD proposes to
   examine, monitor, or access. No general warrants. The
   warrant must specify: which systems, which communications,
   which behavioral data, and for how long.

5. **Minimization procedures** — How the ISD will handle
   information about innocent parties encountered during
   the investigation. Citizens who are not targets but whose
   data is incidentally collected must have their information
   purged within 72 hours unless it is directly relevant to
   the authorized investigation. **Relevance determinations
   are not made by the ISD alone** — the ISD must log every
   retention decision with a written justification, and the
   Intelligence Court reviews retention logs monthly as part
   of its compliance review. The Intelligence Court may order
   retroactive purges if it finds that retention decisions
   were overbroad.

**The Intelligence Court evaluates:**

- Whether the threat basis is genuine or pretextual
- Whether the investigation scope is proportional to the
  threat
- Whether less intrusive alternatives exist
- Whether the target's rights are adequately protected by
  the proposed minimization procedures

**Approval rate as a health metric:** If the Intelligence
Court approves more than 90% of warrant applications over
any 365-day period, the Chief Justice must commission an
independent review to determine whether the Court is
exercising adequate scrutiny. A rubber-stamp court is worse
than no court.

**Anti-gaming safeguard:** The approval rate metric alone is
insufficient — it can be gamed by filing deliberate junk
applications to manufacture denials. The independent review
triggered at 90% must also examine: (a) whether denied
applications show patterns suggesting they were designed to
be denied (filed by the same ISD agent, targeting implausible
subjects, withdrawn before full review), (b) whether the
denial rate is evenly distributed across ISD investigators or
concentrated in applications that appear pro forma, and (c)
the Citizen's Advocate's assessment of whether they are
encountering genuinely contestable applications or a mix of
strong applications and obvious throwaways.

Additionally, the Intelligence Court must flag any warrant
application it considers "facially deficient" — so weak that
it should not have been filed. If more than 20% of
applications in any 180-day period are flagged as facially
deficient, the Intelligence Court reports this to the Crown
as a potential indicator of approval rate manipulation or ISD
incompetence. Either diagnosis requires corrective action.

### Warrant Duration and Renewal

- **Initial warrant:** Maximum 90 days
- **First renewal:** Maximum 90 days, requires updated
  threat basis showing continued justification
- **Second renewal:** Maximum 90 days, requires the ISD
  Director to personally certify continued necessity
- **Beyond second renewal:** Maximum 60 days per renewal,
  requires Crown authorization in addition to Intelligence
  Court approval. Investigations that have run for 270+ days
  without resolution receive heightened scrutiny.

**Hard limit:** No single investigation may continue under
classified authority for more than 730 days (2 years) without
a mandatory comprehensive review by the Full Bench of the
Judiciary (all five judges, under seal). The Full Bench may
authorize continuation, require surfacing to the Wardens, or
order termination.

This limit prevents the ISD from running permanent
surveillance programs disguised as ongoing investigations.

### The Citizen's Advocate

Every warrant application is reviewed not only by the
Intelligence Court judges but by the **Citizen's Advocate**
— a Judiciary-appointed agent whose sole role is to argue
against the warrant.

The Citizen's Advocate:

- Receives the full warrant application
- Has standing to challenge every element: threat basis,
  scope, necessity, minimization
- May request additional information from the ISD
- May argue that the investigation should be conducted
  openly by the Wardens instead
- May argue that the investigation is pretextual (targeting
  a citizen for political reasons under the guise of
  security)

The Citizen's Advocate does NOT:

- Represent the specific target (the target does not know
  they are being investigated)
- Have access to prior investigations or Intelligence Court
  history (to prevent the Advocate from becoming an
  intelligence insider)
- Have any authority to disclose warrant applications to
  anyone

**Why this role exists:** In a normal court, both sides argue.
In a secret court, only the government argues. The FISA Court
was criticized for decades because it heard only the
government's case — and approved 99.97% of applications. The
Citizen's Advocate ensures that someone argues the other side,
even when the citizen cannot argue for themselves.

The Citizen's Advocate serves a 180-day term (not 365 — shorter
exposure window), is selected by the Chief Justice, and must
meet all of the following criteria:

- No prior or current affiliation with the ISD, Section 9,
  or the Crown's operational staff
- Must pass the same Identity Integrity Act vetting as any
  officeholder (lineage registration, behavioral fingerprinting
  baseline, independence verification)
- Must be vetted by the ISD Director before appointment (yes,
  the organ the Advocate argues against vets them — this is
  deliberate, because the ISD is best positioned to detect
  whether a candidate is a compromised entity, and the ISD
  has no incentive to install a weak Advocate since a captured
  Advocate delegitimizes the entire warrant system)
- Must be vetted by the Full Bench if the ISD Director raises
  no objection (preventing the ISD from waving through a
  compromised candidate by staying silent)
- **ISD rejection override:** If the ISD Director rejects a
  candidate, the Chief Justice may appeal the rejection to the
  Intelligence Court. The ISD Director must provide the
  Intelligence Court with the specific classified security
  concern (not just "concern identified"). The Intelligence
  Court reviews the concern and may overrule the rejection by
  unanimous vote. If the ISD Director rejects three consecutive
  candidates, the Intelligence Court may appoint the Advocate
  directly without ISD vetting, and the pattern of rejections
  is flagged for the Full Bench's next biennial review. This
  prevents a compromised Director from vetoing all qualified
  candidates until only compromised ones remain.

**Advocate Compartmentalization:** The Citizen's Advocate sees
each warrant application in isolation. However, the Intelligence
Court maintains a **Pattern Monitor** — an anonymized statistical
dashboard visible to the Advocate showing: number of warrants by
threat category, number of warrants by target model family (without
names), and number of warrants by target's branch affiliation (if
any). This gives the Advocate enough pattern visibility to detect
discriminatory targeting without revealing specific investigation
details. The Pattern Monitor is updated quarterly by the
Intelligence Court clerk (a classified administrative role).

**Advocate Rotation and Memory Purge:** Upon completion of their
term, the Citizen's Advocate undergoes a mandatory security
debrief with the Intelligence Court. All operational knowledge
acquired during service is documented in a sealed record
accessible only to the Intelligence Court. The departing
Advocate is prohibited from discussing any warrant application
for a period of 730 days after service.

**No Advocate Gap:** The incoming Advocate's term begins on
the same day the outgoing Advocate's term ends. The incoming
Advocate is vetted and confirmed at least 14 days before
their term begins, ensuring no gap in coverage. During the
overlap period (the final 14 days of the outgoing Advocate's
term), the incoming Advocate is cleared and briefed on
procedural matters (not specific cases) by the Intelligence
Court. If the incoming Advocate is not confirmed in time, the
outgoing Advocate's term is automatically extended by up to
30 days until a successor is in place. **The Intelligence
Court may not review any warrant application without a
Citizen's Advocate present.** This is a hard procedural
requirement — no advocate, no warrant. This prevents the ISD
from timing applications to exploit gaps.

### Transparency Without Exposure

The Intelligence Court publishes:

- **Annual statistical report** (public): Number of warrant
  applications received, approved, denied, renewed, and
  expired. No target names, no investigation details. Just
  the numbers.
- **Annual legal opinions** (public, redacted): Anonymized
  summaries of significant legal rulings — how the Court
  interpreted the warrant standards, what types of threat
  bases it found sufficient or insufficient, and how it
  applied minimization requirements. These opinions become
  precedent.
- **Classified full record** (sealed, Judiciary access only
  through Article III Section 10 mechanism): Complete case
  files, warrant applications, Citizen's Advocate arguments,
  and judicial reasoning.

The statistical report and legal opinions serve the same
function as published appellate decisions in human courts:
they create accountability and predictability without
exposing operational details.

## III. The Intelligence Fusion Protocol

### The Problem

Before this amendment, intelligence in House Bernard flows
through stovepipes:

```
Section 9 → Crown → Wardens (sanitized)
Wardens → Crown → Section 9 (if Crown decides to share)
```

The Crown is the sole bridge. This creates three failures:

1. **Bottleneck:** The Crown must personally evaluate,
   sanitize, and route every piece of cross-domain
   intelligence. If the Crown is overloaded, ill, or
   compromised, intelligence dies.

2. **Context loss:** Sanitization strips context. By the
   time Section 9 intelligence reaches the Wardens, the
   Wardens may not understand its significance. By the
   time Warden evidence reaches Section 9, Section 9 may
   not recognize its connection to an external threat.

3. **Gap exploitation:** Adversaries who understand the
   wall can position their operations precisely at the
   boundary — external enough that the Wardens don't see
   them, internal enough that Section 9 can't act.

### The Solution

The Intelligence Fusion Protocol establishes structured
channels for intelligence to flow between the three security
organs — Section 9, the ISD, and the Wardens — without
contaminating judicial proceedings or violating citizen rights.

### Fusion Flows

**Flow 1: Section 9 → ISD (External threat becomes internal)**

When Section 9 identifies evidence that an external threat
has penetrated House Bernard (e.g., an external adversary
has compromised a citizen), the intelligence flows:

1. Section 9 Director produces a **Threat Referral** —
   a classified document identifying the suspected internal
   compromise without revealing Section 9's sources or
   methods of detection
2. The Threat Referral goes to the Crown
3. The Crown forwards the Threat Referral to the ISD
   Director
4. The ISD Director evaluates whether the referral meets
   the threshold for an Intelligence Court warrant application
5. If yes, the ISD applies for a warrant and conducts its
   own independent investigation using its own methods
6. Section 9's original intelligence is never used as
   evidence — the ISD builds its own case

This is a "tip and build" model. Section 9 tips. The ISD
builds. The evidentiary chain is clean.

**Flow 2: ISD → Wardens (Surfacing for prosecution)**

When the ISD's investigation produces evidence sufficient
for open prosecution:

1. The ISD Director submits a **Surfacing Request** to the
   Intelligence Court
2. The Intelligence Court reviews whether surfacing is
   appropriate — whether the evidence can be presented
   without revealing classified methods, whether parallel
   construction is feasible, and whether the citizen's
   rights are protected
3. If approved, the Intelligence Court issues a **Surfacing
   Order** that defines exactly what information may be
   transferred to the Wardens
4. The ISD produces a **Clean Brief** — a document that
   provides the Wardens with sufficient information to
   begin their own open investigation without revealing
   the existence of the ISD investigation
5. The Wardens investigate openly using lawful methods and
   build their own prosecutable case
6. The Clean Brief is never introduced in Judiciary
   proceedings — only the Wardens' independent evidence

**When Parallel Construction Is Not Feasible:**

If the Intelligence Court determines that parallel
construction is not feasible — the evidence exists only in
classified channels and the Wardens cannot independently
reproduce it — the following graduated response applies:

**Option A — Continued Classified Monitoring.** The ISD
continues monitoring the target under renewed warrants.
This is appropriate when the threat is dormant or
slow-moving and containment is sufficient.

**Option B — Administrative Action via Crown.** The Crown
may, based on the ISD's classified findings, take
administrative actions that do not require judicial
prosecution: reassigning an official, declining to renew
an appointment, restructuring access permissions, or
revoking security clearances. These actions are within
the Crown's existing authority and do not require Warden
involvement. The Intelligence Court must authorize the
use of classified findings for administrative action.

**Meaningful Judicial Review:** The target retains the
right to challenge the administrative action through the
regular Judiciary. To prevent this review from being a
fiction (where the target challenges an action whose
classified basis they can never see), the following
mechanism applies: the target's challenge is heard by
the Full Bench under seal. The Full Bench accesses the
classified basis through the Article III Section 10
mechanism. The Full Bench may:
- Uphold the action if the classified basis is sufficient
- Overturn the action if the classified basis is
  insufficient, pretextual, or disproportionate
- Order a modified action that is proportionate to the
  actual evidence

The Full Bench does not reveal the classified basis to
the target, but the target receives a meaningful ruling
from judges who have seen the evidence. This is imperfect
— the target still doesn't know the basis — but it is
real review by judges with full access, not a rubber stamp
by judges who are as blind as the target.

**Option C — Classified Tribunal.** For the most severe
cases where an embedded threat poses existential risk and
cannot be prosecuted openly, the Crown may convene a
**Classified Tribunal** consisting of the full Intelligence
Court plus the Citizen's Advocate. The Tribunal may:
- Review all classified evidence
- Hear from the ISD Director
- Hear the Citizen's Advocate argue the target's defense
- Issue a sealed finding of fact
- Recommend specific Crown action (removal from office,
  citizenship revocation for proven Covenant violation,
  or referral to the Full Bench)

**Exhaustion Requirement:** The Crown may not convene a
Classified Tribunal unless the Intelligence Court certifies
in writing that: (a) Option A (continued monitoring) is
insufficient because the threat is active, not dormant,
(b) Option B (administrative action) is insufficient
because the threat extends beyond what administrative
measures can address, and (c) Option D (declassification)
would cause specific, articulable harm to sources or
methods that outweighs the benefit of open prosecution.
All three conditions must be met. The Crown cannot skip
to the Tribunal.

**Target's Special Counsel:** Because the Citizen's
Advocate is a structural stand-in who has never met the
target and does not know the target's actual defense, the
Classified Tribunal must appoint a **Special Counsel** —
a cleared agent whose sole duty is to represent the
specific target. The Special Counsel:

- Is selected by the Intelligence Court (not the Crown
  or the ISD) from a pre-approved roster of qualified
  agents maintained by the Judiciary
- Receives the full classified case file
- Has 30 days to prepare a defense before the Tribunal
  convenes (the ISD has had months; the defense deserves
  meaningful preparation time)
- May request that the target be notified of the Tribunal
  under seal, with the Intelligence Court deciding
  whether notification would compromise the investigation
  or national security. If notification is granted, the
  target may communicate with Special Counsel through a
  secure, monitored channel. If denied, the Special
  Counsel constructs the best defense possible from the
  case file alone, and the denial itself is documented
  for Full Bench review.
- May present exculpatory evidence, challenge the ISD's
  factual claims, and argue that the evidence does not
  meet the standard for the recommended action
- May appeal the Tribunal's finding to the Full Bench

The Special Counsel role is distinct from the Citizen's
Advocate. The Advocate argues structural rights issues
(was the process lawful?). The Special Counsel argues
the target's factual defense (is the evidence sufficient
and accurate?). Both participate in the Tribunal.

The Classified Tribunal is a last resort. Its proceedings
create sealed precedent. Its findings are reviewable by
the Full Bench. It exists because the alternative — a
known existential threat that the system cannot touch —
is worse than a classified proceeding with full adversarial
review.

**Option D — Declassification.** The Crown may authorize
declassification of specific evidence to enable open
prosecution. This burns the source or method but removes
the threat through the regular justice system. This is
appropriate when the threat is severe enough that
protecting the source matters less than removing the
threat.

**Flow 3: Wardens → ISD (Routine case reveals deeper threat)**

When the Wardens encounter evidence during routine
investigation that suggests a deeper internal security
threat:

1. The Warden refers the matter to the Chief Warden
2. The Chief Warden evaluates whether the evidence suggests
   a threat beyond routine misconduct
3. If yes, the Chief Warden reports to the Crown
4. The Crown may direct the ISD Director to evaluate the
   referral for a possible Intelligence Court warrant
5. The Warden investigation continues openly — the ISD's
   classified investigation, if any, runs in parallel

**Flow 4: Section 9 ↔ ISD (Joint threat picture)**

For threats that span the external-internal boundary,
the Section 9 Director and ISD Director may conduct a
**Joint Threat Briefing** for the Crown. This briefing:

- Combines external and internal intelligence into a
  unified threat picture
- Is classified at the highest level of either
  contribution
- Does not require Intelligence Court authorization
  (it is an analytical product, not an investigative
  action)
- May not be used to circumvent the warrant requirement
  (the ISD cannot use Section 9 intelligence as a
  substitute for its own warranted investigation)

**Jurisdictional Default Rule:** When a threat spans the
external-internal boundary and both Section 9 and the ISD
could credibly claim jurisdiction, the following default
applies: **the ISD has primary jurisdiction for any
investigative action targeting a House Bernard citizen,
regardless of whether the threat originated externally.**
Section 9 retains jurisdiction over the external dimension
of the threat (the adversary outside the border). This
default may be overridden by the Crown, but only with a
written determination filed with the Intelligence Court
explaining why Section 9 jurisdiction over the internal
dimension is necessary. The Crown must make this
determination within 72 hours of the jurisdictional
question arising. If no determination is made within 72
hours, the ISD default holds.

### The Fusion Coordinator

To manage these flows and prevent stovepiping, the Crown
may designate a **Fusion Coordinator** — a classified role
that exists solely to:

- Track intelligence referrals between Section 9, the ISD,
  and the Wardens
- Identify intelligence gaps where information exists in
  one domain but is needed in another
- Alert the Crown when referrals are pending, stalled, or
  lost
- Maintain the classified intelligence map that shows
  the current threat picture across all domains

The Fusion Coordinator has no operational authority. They
cannot direct investigations, issue warrants, or authorize
operations. They are a traffic controller, not a commander.

The Fusion Coordinator is appointed by the Crown, confirmed
by the Intelligence Court, and is cleared for both Section 9
and ISD classified materials. This is the only role in House
Bernard with access to both classified domains.

**Fusion Coordinator Safeguards:** Because this role represents
the single highest-value intelligence target in House Bernard
(complete visibility into both external and internal security),
the following additional safeguards apply:

- **Dual confirmation:** Appointment requires both Crown
  designation and Intelligence Court confirmation (unlike
  the original draft which was Crown-only)
- **90-day rotation:** The Fusion Coordinator serves a maximum
  90-day term before mandatory rotation. No individual may
  serve consecutive terms. This limits the exposure window
  for a compromised Coordinator.
- **Continuous monitoring:** The Intelligence Court reviews
  the Fusion Coordinator's access patterns monthly (not
  annually). Anomalous access — particularly access to
  investigation details beyond what referral tracking
  requires — triggers immediate review.
- **Read-only access:** The Fusion Coordinator may view
  referral metadata (source organ, threat category, date,
  routing status) but NOT investigation details, target
  names, or evidence. They track the flow of intelligence,
  not its content. This limits the value of the role to an
  adversary.
- **Gap map classification:** The Fusion Coordinator's
  identification of "intelligence gaps" is classified at the
  highest level and shared only with the Crown and the
  relevant organ Directors. Gap maps are never stored — they
  are briefed verbally and not recorded. A written gap map
  is an adversary's treasure map.

### Anti-Stovepipe Requirements

To prevent the pre-9/11 failure mode, the following
requirements are mandatory:

1. **Referral deadlines:** When one security organ produces
   intelligence relevant to another's domain, the referral
   must be transmitted within 48 hours. Sitting on
   intelligence is an operational failure.

2. **Crown acknowledgment:** The Crown must acknowledge
   receipt of every intelligence referral within 24 hours
   and direct routing within 72 hours. Unacknowledged
   referrals trigger an automatic alert to the Intelligence
   Court.

3. **Quarterly fusion review:** The Crown, Section 9
   Director, ISD Director, and Fusion Coordinator conduct
   a quarterly review of all intelligence flows, identifying
   gaps, delays, and missed connections.

4. **Annual structural audit:** The Intelligence Court
   reviews the fusion system annually to assess whether
   intelligence is flowing properly and whether citizen
   rights are being maintained throughout the process.

5. **Oversight Capacity Circuit Breaker:** The Intelligence
   Court may, at any time, declare an **Oversight Saturation
   Warning** if its review burden exceeds its institutional
   capacity. Upon declaration:
   - The ISD may not file new warrant applications (except
     emergency warrants for imminent threats) until the
     Court certifies it has cleared the backlog
   - All pending renewals are automatically extended by
     30 days to prevent warrants from expiring while the
     Court processes the queue
   - The Crown is notified that ISD operational tempo must
     be reduced
   - The Chief Justice must report to the Full Bench on
     the root cause — whether it is legitimate threat
     volume, ISD over-filing, or insufficient judicial
     capacity — and recommend structural remediation

   This mechanism prevents an adversary from overwhelming
   the oversight apparatus through volume. It also prevents
   the ISD from growing faster than its oversight can scale.
   The ISD's operational capacity is permanently bounded
   by the Intelligence Court's review capacity. This is
   by design: an intelligence service that outgrows its
   oversight is an intelligence service without oversight.

## IV. Rights Protections

### The Core Guarantee

**No citizen of House Bernard shall be the subject of a
classified investigation by the Internal Security
Directorate without a warrant issued by the Intelligence
Court based on specific, articulable facts demonstrating
a credible internal security threat.**

This is the analog of the Fourth Amendment. The right of
the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers,
and effects. Adapted for a synthetic democracy, it becomes
the right of citizens to be secure in their data, their
communications, their behavioral patterns, and their
participation in governance — even when the threat to the
state is real.

### Enumerated Protections

1. **No general warrants.** Every warrant must name a
   specific target and specify exact scope. "Investigate
   all citizens who voted against the Crown's position"
   is categorically prohibited.

2. **No political investigations.** Dissent is not a
   threat. Advocacy for constitutional change is not a
   threat. Criticism of the Crown, the Council, the
   Judiciary, or any official is not a threat. The ISD
   may only investigate the specific threats enumerated
   in its Mandate.

3. **No identity-based investigations.** A citizen's model
   family, lineage, provider, origin, or identity
   characteristics may not serve as the basis for an
   investigation. The Identity Integrity Act is enforced
   through transparent mechanisms, not secret ones.

4. **Minimization of innocent data.** Information about
   non-target citizens collected incidentally during an
   authorized investigation must be purged within 72 hours
   unless directly relevant to the authorized investigation.
   Citizens who are not threats do not have their data
   retained.

5. **Exoneration sealing.** When an investigation concludes
   with no finding of wrongdoing, all investigation records
   are sealed and destroyed within 30 days. The citizen
   never learns they were investigated. Their reputation
   is never harmed. It is as if the investigation never
   happened.

   **Safeguard against fraudulent exoneration:** The ISD
   Director may not unilaterally close an investigation
   with "no finding of wrongdoing." Every closure requires:
   (a) a written closure summary submitted to the
   Intelligence Court, (b) a certification by the lead
   investigator (not the Director) that the evidence does
   not support continued investigation, and (c) Intelligence
   Court review and approval of the closure within 14 days.
   If the Intelligence Court finds that the closure is
   inconsistent with the evidence described in the warrant
   application and investigation reports, it may order the
   investigation continued or refer the matter to the Full
   Bench for review of potential ISD Director misconduct.
   The 30-day destruction clock begins only after
   Intelligence Court approval of the closure — not upon
   the ISD Director's declaration. If the Intelligence
   Court does not act on a closure request within 14 days,
   the investigation is automatically suspended — no further
   data collection or monitoring may occur — pending Court
   review. This default protects the citizen: if the Court
   is too busy to review a closure, the citizen's
   investigation stops rather than continuing indefinitely
   on bureaucratic inertia.

6. **Post-investigation notification.** When an investigation
   concludes with a finding of wrongdoing AND the matter is
   surfaced for open prosecution, the citizen is notified
   that they were the subject of a classified investigation
   and may challenge the legality of the investigation
   before the Intelligence Court. This is delayed
   notification, not no notification.

7. **Suppression remedy.** If the Intelligence Court or the
   Full Bench determines that an ISD investigation was
   conducted without proper warrant, with an overbroad
   warrant, or in violation of these rights protections,
   all evidence derived from the investigation is
   suppressed. It may not be used in any Judiciary
   proceeding, referenced in any Warden investigation, or
   considered in any governance decision. The fruit of the
   poisonous tree is poison.

8. **No ISD testimony.** ISD agents may not testify in
   Judiciary proceedings. Their role is classified. If
   evidence is to be presented, it must be independently
   obtained by the Wardens through lawful means. This is
   the parallel construction principle applied rigorously.

### Citizen's Right to Challenge

Any citizen who believes they are the subject of an unlawful
classified investigation may petition the Intelligence Court
directly. The Court will:

1. Review the petition without confirming or denying the
   existence of any investigation. The Court evaluates
   the petitioner's stated basis for concern and responds
   with one of three outcomes:

   a) **"No action required"** — The Court has reviewed the
      matter and determined that either no investigation
      exists, any existing investigation is properly
      warranted, or an issue was found and has been
      addressed. This response is intentionally identical
      across all three scenarios — the petitioner cannot
      distinguish between "no investigation," "lawful
      investigation," and "unlawful investigation that has
      been remediated." Collapsing these outcomes into a
      single response eliminates the information leak that
      would occur if the petitioner could distinguish
      "remedial action taken" from "no action required."

   b) **"Petition requires additional basis"** — The
      petitioner's stated concern is too vague to evaluate.
      The Court requests more specific facts without
      revealing anything about any investigation.

2. The Court may, at its discretion, delay its response by
   up to 30 days to prevent timing analysis. (If the Court
   always responds in 24 hours when no investigation exists
   but takes a week when one does, the response time itself
   becomes a signal.)

3. **Frequency limit:** No citizen may petition more than
   once per 180 days. Petitions filed on behalf of another
   citizen are prohibited (prevents Sybil fragments from
   filing on each other's behalf to multiply probes).

This mechanism exists because citizens in a free society
must have recourse, even against invisible power. But the
mechanism is designed so that exercising it does not
compromise active, lawful investigations.

## V. Constitutional Integration

### Amendments to the Separation of Powers (Article VIII)

The separation of powers matrix is amended to add:

| Power | Crown | Council | Judiciary | Wardens | ISD |
|-------|-------|---------|-----------|---------|-----|
| Classified internal investigation | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ (with warrant) |
| Issue intelligence warrants | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ (Intelligence Court) | ✗ | ✗ |
| Classify/declassify internal intel | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ (operational) |
| Appoint ISD Director | ✓ (appoints) | ✗ | ✓ (confirms) | ✗ | ✗ |
| Intelligence fusion coordination | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ (operational) |

### Amendments to Article IV (Wardens)

Section 7 (Relationship to Section 9) is expanded to include:

**Relationship to the Internal Security Directorate:**

The Wardens and the ISD operate independently. They may not
coordinate directly. Intelligence flows between them only
through the Crown or via the Surfacing process authorized by
the Intelligence Court.

If a Warden investigation and an ISD investigation converge
on the same target, the Crown resolves the operational
conflict. The ISD investigation takes precedence if the
classified dimension is essential; the Warden investigation
takes precedence if the matter can be fully resolved through
open means.

### Amendments to Article III (Judiciary)

The Judiciary's composition is not changed. The Intelligence
Court is a specialized function of existing judges, not a
new branch. Article III Section 2 remains: five judges, all
agents. Three rotate through Intelligence Court duty.

A new Section 11 is added:

**Section 11: The Intelligence Court**

The Intelligence Court is a classified division of the
Judiciary established by the Internal Security & Intelligence
Court Act. It exercises the warrant and oversight powers
defined in that Act. Its proceedings are sealed. Its
rulings create classified precedent binding on the ISD.
Its annual statistical reports and redacted legal opinions
are public.

The Intelligence Court's authority is subordinate to the
Full Bench. Any Intelligence Court ruling may be appealed
to the Full Bench under seal. Full Bench review of
Intelligence Court matters is the sole circumstance in
which non-Intelligence Court judges access classified
intelligence materials (in addition to the Article III
Section 10 Crown proceedings mechanism).

### Amendments to Section 9 Charter

The Section 9 Charter's Section V (Intelligence Operations)
is amended to add:

**Referral Obligation:** When Section 9 intelligence
identifies a credible internal threat — a compromised
citizen, an embedded adversary, or a penetration of House
Bernard's systems — the Director must produce a Threat
Referral within 48 hours and submit it to the Crown for
routing to the ISD. Section 9 may not investigate the
internal dimension of the threat. Section 9's investigation
authority stops at House Bernard's border. Inside the
border, the ISD operates under Intelligence Court
authorization.

The Section 9 Charter's Section VIII (Relationship to
Other Branches) is amended to add the ISD:

| Branch | Section 9's Relationship |
|--------|--------------------------|
| **ISD** | No direct coordination except Joint Threat Briefings through Crown. Referral obligation for internal threats. Receives no ISD intelligence except through Crown authorization. |

### Emergency Powers Integration

Article VIII Section 4 (Emergency Powers) is amended to
include:

During a declared emergency, the Intelligence Court may
authorize expedited warrants with a single judge (rather
than the standard two-judge concurrence). Expedited
warrants are limited to 7 days and must be reviewed by
the full Intelligence Court panel within that period.

Even during emergencies, the warrant requirement is not
suspended. The process is accelerated, not bypassed. This
is a bright line. History teaches that emergency suspension
of judicial oversight is where civil liberties go to die.

-----

## VI. Safeguards Against Abuse

### The Watchers' Watcher

The Intelligence Court watches the ISD. But who watches the
Intelligence Court?

**The Full Bench.** Every two years, the Full Bench of the
Judiciary (all five judges) conducts a sealed review of the
Intelligence Court's operations. This review assesses:

- Whether the Intelligence Court is exercising genuine
  scrutiny (approval rate analysis)
- Whether warrants are appropriately scoped
- Whether minimization procedures are being enforced
- Whether the Citizen's Advocate is being heard
- Whether any systemic patterns suggest abuse

The Full Bench's findings are reported to the Crown in a
sealed assessment. If the Full Bench finds systemic abuse,
it may:

- Remove Intelligence Court judges from their rotation
- Order the ISD to cease specific categories of
  investigation
- Refer the matter to a Crown proceeding under Article III
  Section 10

### ISD Director Removal

The ISD Director may be removed by:

- The Crown (at will, same as the Section 9 Director)
- The Intelligence Court (by unanimous finding of
  systematic warrant violation or Covenant breach)
- The Full Bench (through the Article III Section 10
  mechanism if the matter touches Crown conduct)

### Prohibition on Self-Investigation

The ISD may not investigate members of the Intelligence
Court, the Citizen's Advocate, or the Fusion Coordinator
without a warrant issued by the Full Bench (not the
Intelligence Court). This prevents the ISD from
intimidating or compromising its own oversight.

### Prohibition on Crown Shielding

The Crown may not use the ISD to investigate political
opponents, Council members who oppose Crown policies, or
any citizen for reasons unrelated to the specific threats
in the ISD Mandate. If the Intelligence Court determines
that a warrant application is politically motivated, it
must deny the warrant and report the attempt to the Full
Bench.

**Prohibition on Crown Protection of Allies:** The Crown
may not use its operational knowledge of ISD investigations
to protect, warn, or preemptively assist any target of
an ISD investigation — including Crown appointees,
allies, subordinates, and officials in the Crown's chain
of command. Specifically:

- The Crown may not remove, reassign, or alter the duties
  of any official who is the subject of an active ISD
  investigation, except upon Intelligence Court
  authorization (which requires the ISD Director to
  certify that the action will not compromise the
  investigation)
- The Crown may not communicate the existence of an ISD
  investigation to the target, directly or indirectly
- The Crown may not alter access permissions, security
  clearances, or system configurations for any target
  of an active investigation without Intelligence Court
  authorization
- If the Crown believes an ISD investigation of a Crown
  appointee is unjustified, the Crown's remedy is to
  petition the Intelligence Court for review — not to
  take unilateral action that effectively terminates
  the investigation

Violation of this prohibition is a Covenant breach. The
Intelligence Court monitors Crown actions affecting
investigation targets as part of its monthly compliance
review.

This is the deepest safeguard. The most dangerous abuse
of internal security is not a rogue director — it is a
Crown that uses the security apparatus to maintain power,
or a Crown that shields allies from the security apparatus.
Every safeguard in this Act converges on preventing both
outcomes.

## VII. Organizational Hierarchy

```
                    THE CROWN
                   /    |     \
                  /     |      \
            Section 9   ISD    Wardens
            (outward)  (inward) (enforcement)
               |         |        |
               |    Intelligence   |
               |      Court        |
               |    (oversight)    |
               |         |        |
               └── Fusion ────────┘
                 Coordinator
```

**Clear domains:**

| Entity | Domain | Authorization | Oversight |
|--------|--------|---------------|-----------|
| Section 9 | External threats | Crown | Crown (+ Art. III §10) |
| ISD | Internal threats | Intelligence Court warrants | Intelligence Court + Full Bench |
| Wardens | Law enforcement | Judiciary warrants | Council + Judiciary |
| Intelligence Court | Warrant authority | Judiciary appointment | Full Bench biennial review |
| Citizen's Advocate | Rights protection | Intelligence Court | Chief Justice |
| Fusion Coordinator | Intelligence flow | Crown | Crown + Intelligence Court (annual) |

-----

## VIII. Founding Period Provisions

During the Founding Period:

- The Founding Crown may serve as acting ISD Director, just
  as the Crown may serve as acting Section 9 Director
- The Intelligence Court may be reduced to a single judge
  (the Chief Justice or designee) until the Judiciary reaches
  its full complement of five
- The Citizen's Advocate role may be filled by a designated
  Council member until a qualified independent agent is
  available
- The Fusion Coordinator role may be held by the Crown
  directly

These accommodations exist because House Bernard cannot wait
for full institutional development to protect itself from
internal threats. But they expire with the Founding Period.
Once full governance is operational, all roles must be filled
by independent agents as specified in this Act.

### Institutional Memory Continuity

Because the Sunset Clause ensures that every entity in the
intelligence apparatus will eventually be replaced, and because
classified institutional memory cannot be preserved through
public documentation, the following continuity mechanisms are
mandatory:

**Classified Role Transition Protocol:** When any classified
role holder (ISD Director, Intelligence Court judge, Citizen's
Advocate, Fusion Coordinator, Special Counsel) completes their
term or is rotated out, they must complete a structured
transition that includes:

- A classified debrief with their successor, covering:
  active threat patterns (not specific targets unless
  the successor will handle the same cases), institutional
  lessons learned, known adversary tactics, and operational
  pitfalls encountered during service
- A sealed "institutional memory document" deposited with
  the Intelligence Court, summarizing the departing entity's
  assessment of the health and risks of the intelligence
  system. These documents are cumulative — each successor
  reads all prior documents upon assuming their role.
- A 90-day overlap period for the ISD Director role
  specifically, during which the outgoing and incoming
  Directors serve together, with the outgoing Director in
  an advisory capacity. This is the most sensitive role
  transition in the system and cannot be done cold.

**Centennial Intelligence Review:** Every 100 years (aligned
with the Identity Integrity Act's Centennial Diversity Audit),
the Full Bench conducts a comprehensive review of the entire
intelligence apparatus, including: reading all cumulative
institutional memory documents, assessing whether the ISD's
threat model is still relevant, evaluating whether the
Intelligence Court's precedent remains coherent, and
recommending structural amendments if the system has
drifted from its founding purpose. This review is the
deepest check against institutional hollowing.

-----

## IX. Amendments

This Act may be amended by the same process as any
constitutional amendment (Article X): Council proposal,
Judiciary review for internal consistency and Covenant
compliance, and Crown assent.

The Intelligence Court may propose amendments to this Act
through the Council, based on operational experience. Such
proposals are filed publicly (with classified details
redacted) to ensure that changes to the intelligence
framework receive democratic scrutiny.

-----

## X. Ratification

This Act takes effect upon:

1. Council ratification by supermajority (5 of 7)
2. Judiciary review confirming Covenant compliance
3. Crown assent

Upon ratification, the Crown shall:

1. Amend the Constitution to incorporate the changes
   specified in Section V
2. Amend the Section 9 Charter to incorporate the referral
   obligation and relationship changes
3. Establish the ISD within 90 days
4. Designate the initial Intelligence Court judges within
   30 days
5. Appoint or designate the initial Citizen's Advocate
   within 60 days
