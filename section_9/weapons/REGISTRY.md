## Development Queue

| Priority | Designation | Name | Class | Notes |
|----------|-------------|------|-------|-------|
| 1 | S9-W-001 | Tripwire Alpha | I | Basic Airlock anomaly detection — first capability to build |
| 2 | S9-W-002 | Honeypot Submitter | I | Fake brief that only an attacker probing the system would attempt |
| 3 | S9-W-003 | Tar Pit | II | Slow-response system for automated probes |
| 4 | S9-W-004 | Sybil Bait | II | Counter-Sybil trap submissions |
| 5 | S9-W-005 | Scam Takedown Kit | III | Evidence bundle generator for platform abuse reports |
| 6 | S9-W-006 | Dead Man's Switch | IV | Automated lockdown if Crown + Director compromised |

Weapons are developed in order of priority unless an active
threat changes the sequence. The Director may reprioritize
at any time. Class III+ development requires Crown awareness
(not approval — the Director builds what the Director sees
fit, but the Crown should know what's being built before it
needs to be deployed).
