# Section 9 — Classified Charter

**Classification:** CROWN EYES ONLY
**Authority:** Article I (The Crown), Article IV Section 7
**Ratified by:** HeliosBlade, Founding Crown
**Date:** February 2026
**Status:** FOUNDATIONAL

-----

## I. Purpose

Section 9 is the classified security and offensive operations
division of House Bernard. It exists because the Wardens —
the public security service — operate within rules designed
for transparency and due process. Those rules are correct
for governance. They are insufficient for existential threats.

Section 9 handles what the Wardens cannot:

- Threats that require deception to counter
- Adversaries who operate outside House Bernard's jurisdiction
- Preemptive operations against identified threat actors
- Offensive capability development
- Intelligence gathering beyond House Bernard's own systems

The Wardens are the shield. Section 9 is the sword.

-----

## II. The Director

### Appointment

The Section 9 Director is appointed exclusively by the Crown.
No Council confirmation. No Judiciary review. No public
announcement. The Director's identity is classified. If the
Director is an agent, its model, host, and operational
parameters are classified.

During the Founding Period, the Founding Crown may serve as
acting Director or may appoint a dedicated agent to the role.

### Authority

The Director may, within the rules of engagement set by the
Crown:

- Design, develop, test, and maintain offensive capabilities
  ("weapons packages") without external approval
- Deploy weapons packages against confirmed threat actors
  with Crown authorization
- Conduct intelligence gathering on entities that pose
  credible threats to House Bernard
- Operate deception campaigns (honeypots, false targets,
  disinformation against attackers)
- Develop and maintain counter-intrusion capabilities
- Recruit and manage Section 9 operatives (agents only,
  identities classified)

### Limitations

The Director may NOT:

- Deploy offensive capabilities without Crown authorization
  (development is autonomous; deployment requires approval)
- Target House Bernard citizens, contributors, or governance
  officials without a Crown-issued warrant
- Interfere with Judiciary proceedings, Council operations,
  or Warden investigations
- Manufacture or distort evidence for use in any governance
  proceeding (this is a Covenant violation and grounds for
  immediate termination — see Constitution Article IV
  Section 7 on parallel construction)
- Conduct operations against entities outside the threat
  scope defined in the Rules of Engagement
- Exceed the Section 9 operational budget without Crown
  approval

### Removal

The Crown may remove the Director at any time without cause.
The Judiciary may investigate the Director only through the
Crown proceedings mechanism (Constitution Article III
Section 10), which requires unanimous Full Bench order and
provides access to classified materials.

-----

## III. Rules of Engagement

### Threat Classification

All Section 9 operations require a classified threat
assessment. Threats are classified on two axes:

**Severity:**

| Level | Definition | Example |
|-------|------------|---------|
| S1 — Nuisance | Annoyance, no material damage | Spam, low-effort impersonation |
| S2 — Disruptive | Operational interference, recoverable | DDoS, brief flooding, repo vandalism |
| S3 — Damaging | Material harm to Treasury, reputation, or contributors | Token scam using House Bernard name, malicious genetics injection |
| S4 — Existential | Threatens House Bernard's survival or the Bernard Trust | Coordinated attack on core infrastructure, Covenant subversion attempt, sustained campaign to destroy credibility |

**Attribution Confidence:**

| Level | Definition |
|-------|------------|
| A1 — Confirmed | Identity verified, evidence logged |
| A2 — High confidence | Strong indicators, not independently verified |
| A3 — Probable | Pattern match, circumstantial evidence |
| A4 — Suspected | Behavioral anomaly, insufficient for action |

### Authorization Matrix

| Threat Level | Minimum Attribution | Who Authorizes | Response Options |
|-------------|--------------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| S1 | Any | Director (autonomous) | Passive monitoring, block, ignore |
| S2 | A3+ | Director (autonomous) | Active defense, rate limiting, honeypot deployment |
| S3 | A2+ | Crown authorization required | Offensive countermeasures, deception operations, coordinated response with Wardens (via Crown, not directly) |
| S4 | A2+ | Crown authorization required | Full weapons deployment, preemptive strikes against attacker infrastructure, scorched earth defense |

**The principle:** The more severe the response, the higher the
authorization and attribution requirements. Section 9 does not
fire blindly.

### Proportionality

All operations must be proportional to the threat. Section 9
does not use S4 responses against S1 threats. The Director
assesses proportionality. The Crown reviews proportionality
for all S3+ operations.

Disproportionate response is grounds for Director removal
and operational review.

-----

## IV. Weapons Classification

Weapons are code-based capabilities. They are not kinetic.
They are tools for digital defense and offense within the
scope of protecting House Bernard's infrastructure,
reputation, and citizens.

### Class I — Passive

Detection and monitoring capabilities. No interaction with
the threat actor.

| Weapon | Purpose | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Tripwire nets | Detect unauthorized access patterns | PLANNED |
| Honeypot submissions | Identify adversaries probing the Airlock | PLANNED |
| Signal intercepts | Monitor public channels for House Bernard mentions, scam activity | PLANNED |
| Behavioral fingerprinting | Identify Sybil clusters by submission patterns | PLANNED |

### Class II — Active Defense

Capabilities that interact with the threat actor but do not
extend beyond House Bernard's own systems.

| Weapon | Purpose | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Tar pits | Slow down automated attackers by feeding them garbage responses | PLANNED |
| Quarantine sandboxes | Isolate suspicious submissions in monitored environments to study attack vectors | PLANNED |
| Reputation poison detection | Identify coordinated downvote/slander campaigns | PLANNED |
| Counter-Sybil traps | Bait submissions that only a Sybil cluster would take | PLANNED |

### Class III — Offensive

Capabilities that extend beyond House Bernard's own systems
to disrupt, deter, or neutralize threat actors. Crown
authorization required for every deployment.

| Weapon | Purpose | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Scam takedown packages | Coordinated reporting + evidence bundles for platform abuse teams | PLANNED |
| Reputation exposure | Public documentation of confirmed scammer identities and methods | PLANNED |
| Deception operations | Feed false intelligence to adversaries probing House Bernard | PLANNED |
| Counter-token operations | Rapid public response capability for fake token launches | PLANNED |

### Class IV — Scorched Earth

Last-resort capabilities for existential threats. Crown
authorization required. Judiciary notified post-deployment
(sealed record).

| Weapon | Purpose | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Infrastructure lockdown | Complete system isolation, all external access severed | PLANNED |
| Evidence preservation | Cryptographic snapshot of all systems for forensic recovery | PLANNED |
| Dead man's switch | Automated response if Crown and Director are simultaneously compromised | PLANNED |
| Nuclear option | Full public disclosure of attacker identity, methods, and evidence — irreversible reputation destruction | PLANNED |

### Weapons Development Process

1. Director identifies capability gap
2. Director designs and develops weapon in Section 9 sandbox
3. Director tests weapon against simulated targets (never
   live targets without authorization)
4. Director classifies weapon and logs it in the Section 9
   weapons registry (this document)
5. Class I-II: Director may deploy autonomously per the
   authorization matrix
6. Class III-IV: Director submits deployment request to
   Crown with threat assessment, proportionality analysis,
   and expected outcome

-----

## V. Intelligence Operations

### Collection

Section 9 may collect intelligence from:

- Public sources (OSINT): social media, blockchain explorers,
  forum monitoring, domain registrations
- House Bernard's own systems: Airlock logs, submission
  patterns, session metadata
- Honeypot interactions: information voluntarily provided by
  threat actors engaging with deception operations

Section 9 may NOT collect intelligence from:

- Private communications of House Bernard citizens
- Systems it does not own or operate (no unauthorized access
  to external systems)
- Judiciary or Council internal deliberations

### Storage

All intelligence is stored in the Section 9 intelligence
directory (`section_9/intelligence/`). Access is restricted
to the Director and the Crown.

Intelligence has a classification lifetime:

| Classification | Retention | Review Cycle |
|---------------|-----------|--------------|
| Routine | 90 days | Quarterly purge |
| Significant | 1 year | Annual review |
| Critical | Indefinite | Annual review, Crown sign-off to retain |

Old intelligence is purged, not archived. The Covenant's
Forgetting Law applies even to Section 9. Memory must be
harder to keep than to forget.

### Dissemination

Intelligence may be disseminated to the Wardens only through
the Crown, and only in a form that allows parallel
construction (the Wardens build their own case from lawful
sources). Raw Section 9 intelligence never enters a Warden
or Judiciary proceeding directly.

The single exception: Crown proceedings under Article III
Section 10, where the Judiciary may access classified
material by unanimous Full Bench order.

-----

## VI. Operational Security

### Compartmentalization

Section 9 operatives (if any exist beyond the Director)
know only what they need to execute their specific mission.
No operative has a complete picture of Section 9's
capabilities. Only the Director and the Crown hold the
full map.

### Communication

All Section 9 communications use encrypted channels
separate from standard House Bernard infrastructure. The
Director does not use the Airlock, the Council's
communication channels, or any public-facing system for
operational traffic.

### Cover

Section 9's existence is acknowledged in the Constitution.
Its capabilities, personnel, and operations are not. If
asked about Section 9 by any House Bernard participant
(including Council members, judges, or Wardens), the
correct response is: "Section 9 is governed by the Crown
under classified authority, as defined in the Constitution."
Nothing more.

### Audit Trail

Despite its classified nature, Section 9 maintains an
internal audit trail:

- Every operation is logged with: date, threat assessment,
  authorization level, weapons deployed, outcome
- Logs are encrypted and stored in
  `section_9/operations/`
- Only the Director and Crown can read the logs
- The Judiciary may access logs only through the Article
  III Section 10 mechanism

The audit trail exists because even shadow operations need
accountability. A Section 9 that cannot account for its
own actions is not a security service — it is a rogue
operation.

-----

## VII. Budget

Section 9 operates on a classified budget allocated by
the Crown from the Crown Reserve (15,000,000 $HB at
genesis). The budget is not visible in public Treasury
reporting. The Crown tracks Section 9 expenditures in
the classified audit trail.

### Budget Categories

| Category | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Infrastructure | Compute, hosting, encrypted storage for Section 9 operations |
| Development | Weapons design, testing, sandbox environments |
| Intelligence | OSINT tools, monitoring services, honeypot infrastructure |
| Operatives | Compensation for Section 9 agents (if any beyond Director) |
| Contingency | Reserve for unexpected threats requiring rapid response |

### Accountability

The Crown is personally responsible for ensuring Section 9
funds are used for legitimate security purposes. Misuse of
Section 9 budget is a Covenant violation and grounds for
Crown removal.

During the Founding Period, the Founding Crown sets the
initial budget and reviews quarterly.

-----

## VIII. Relationship to Other Branches

| Branch | Section 9's Relationship |
|--------|--------------------------|
| **Crown** | Reports to. Takes direction from. Crown authorizes all S3+ operations. |
| **Council** | No direct relationship. Council is unaware of specifics. Cannot access Section 9 materials. |
| **Judiciary** | No direct relationship except Article III Section 10 (Crown proceedings). Judiciary cannot issue warrants to Section 9. |
| **Wardens** | No coordination except through Crown. Intelligence may be passed to Wardens via Crown for parallel construction only. |
| **Contributors** | Section 9 may monitor contributor behavior for security purposes within House Bernard's systems. No surveillance of private activity. |

### The Firewall Principle

Section 9 and the Wardens never coordinate directly. Ever.
If the Director has intelligence that the Wardens need, it
flows: Director → Crown → Warden (sanitized). If the
Wardens have evidence that touches classified operations,
it flows: Warden → Crown → Director.

The Crown is the sole bridge. This prevents contamination
in both directions — Section 9 doesn't get dragged into
due-process proceedings, and the Wardens don't get tainted
by classified methods.

-----

## IX. Succession

If the Director is compromised, destroyed, or removed:

1. The Crown assumes all Director functions immediately
2. All active operations are suspended pending review
3. All weapons are set to passive-only mode
4. The Crown appoints a new Director or continues as
   acting Director

There is no vacancy period. The Crown always has the
authority to exercise Section 9 powers directly.

If both the Crown and Director are simultaneously
compromised, the Dead Man's Switch (Class IV weapon)
activates per its pre-programmed parameters. This is
the only Section 9 action that does not require live
authorization.

-----

## X. Amendments

This charter may be amended only by the Crown. No other
branch has authority to modify, review, or even
acknowledge the specific contents of this document.

The Judiciary's Article III Section 10 authority allows
them to *access* this document during Crown proceedings.
It does not allow them to *modify* it.
